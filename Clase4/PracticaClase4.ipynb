and its impacts on earth\\'s weather patterns there have been previous periods of climate change, but the current changes are distinctly more rapid and not due to natural causes instead, they are

industrial processes, and forest loss are additional sources greenhouse gases are transparent to sunlight, allowing it through to heat the earth\\'s surface when the earth emits that heat as infrared

common increased warming in the arctic has contributed to melting permafrost, glacial retreat and sea ice loss higher temperatures are also causing more intense storms, droughts, and other weather

increased flooding, extreme heat, more disease, and economic loss human migration and conflict can be a result the world health organization (who) calls climate change the greatest threat to global

these impacts are already felt at the current 1 2\\xa0°c (2 2\\xa0°f) level of warming additional warming will increase these impacts and may trigger tipping points, such as the melting of the greenland ice sheet under the 2015 paris agreement, nations collectively agreed to keep warming \"well under 2\\xa0°c\" however, with pledges made under the agreement, global warming would still reach about 2 7\\xa0°c (4 9\\xa0°f) by the end of the century limiting warming to 1 5\\xa0°c will require halving emissions by 2030 and achieving net-zero emissions by 2050 making deep cuts in emissions will require switching away from burning fossil fuels and towards using electricity generated from low-carbon sources this includes phasing out coal-fired power plants, vastly increasing use of wind, solar, and other types of renewable energy, and taking measures to reduce energy use electricity will need to replace fossil fuels for powering transportation, heating buildings, and operating industrial facilities carbon can also be removed from the atmosphere, for instance by increasing forest cover and by farming with methods that capture carbon in soil while communities may adapt to climate change through efforts like better coastline protection, they cannot avert the risk of severe, widespread, and permanent impacts before the 1980s, it was unclear whether warming by increased greenhouse gases would dominate aerosol-induced cooling scientists then often used the term inadvertent climate modification to refer to the human impact on the climate in the 1980s, the terms global warming and climate change were popularised the former refers only to increased surface warming, the latter describes the full effect of greenhouse gases on the climate global warming became the most popular term after nasa climate scientist james hansen used it in his 1988 testimony in the u s senate in the 2000s, the term climate change increased in popularity global warming usually refers to human-induced warming of the earth system, whereas climate change can refer to natural or anthropogenic change the two terms are often used interchangeably various scientists, politicians and media figures have adopted the terms climate crisis or climate emergency to talk about climate change, and global heating instead of global warming the policy editor-in-chief of the guardian said they included this language in their editorial guidelines \"to ensure that we are being scientifically precise, while also communicating clearly with readers on this very important issue\" in 2019, oxford languages chose climate emergency as its word of the year, defining it as \"a situation in which urgent action is required to reduce or halt climate change and avoid potentially irreversible environmental damage resulting from it\" multiple independent instrumental datasets show that the climate system is warming the 2011–2020 decade warmed to an average 1 09\\xa0°c [0 95–1 20\\xa0°c] compared to the pre-industrial baseline (1850–1900) surface temperatures are rising by about 0 2\\xa0°c per decade, with 2020 reaching a temperature of 1 2\\xa0°c above the pre-industrial era since 1950, the number of cold days and nights has decreased, and the number of warm days and nights has increased there was little net warming between the 18th century and the mid-19th century climate information for that period comes from climate proxies, such as trees and ice cores thermometer records began to provide global coverage around 1850 historical patterns of warming and cooling, like the medieval climate anomaly and the little ice age, did not occur at the same time across different regions temperatures may have reached as high as those of the late-20th century in a limited set of regions there have been prehistorical episodes of global warming, such as the paleocene–eocene thermal maximum however, the modern observed rise in temperature and co2 concentrations has been so rapid that even abrupt geophysical events in earth\\'s history do not approach current rates evidence of warming from air temperature measurements are reinforced with a wide range of other observations there has been an increase in the frequency and intensity of heavy precipitation, melting of snow and land ice, and increased atmospheric humidity flora and fauna are also behaving in a manner consistent with warming; for instance, plants are flowering earlier in spring another key indicator is the cooling of the upper atmosphere, which demonstrates that greenhouse gases are trapping heat near the earth\\'s surface and preventing it from radiating into space regions of the world warm at differing rates the pattern is independent of where greenhouse gases are emitted, because the gases persist long enough to diffuse across the planet since the pre-industrial period, the average surface temperature over land regions has increased almost twice as fast as the global-average surface temperature this is because of the larger heat capacity of oceans, and because oceans lose more heat by evaporation the thermal energy in the global climate system has grown with only brief pauses since at least 1970, and over 90% of this extra energy has been stored in the ocean the rest has heated the atmosphere, melted ice, and warmed the continents the northern hemisphere and the north pole have warmed much faster than the south pole and southern hemisphere the northern hemisphere not only has much more land, but also more seasonal snow cover and sea ice as these surfaces flip from reflecting a lot of light to being dark after the ice has melted, they start absorbing more heat local black carbon deposits on snow and ice also contribute to arctic warming arctic temperatures are increasing at over twice the rate of the rest of the world melting of glaciers and ice sheets in the arctic disrupts ocean circulation, including a weakened gulf stream, further changing the climate the climate system experiences various cycles on its own which can last for years (such as the el niño–southern oscillation (enso)), decades or even centuries other changes are caused by an imbalance of energy that is \"external\" to the climate system, but not always external to the earth examples of external forcings include changes in the concentrations of greenhouse gases, solar luminosity, volcanic eruptions, and variations in the earth\\'s orbit around the sun to determine the human contribution to climate change, known internal climate variability and natural external forcings need to be ruled out a key approach is to determine unique \"fingerprints\" for all potential causes, then compare these fingerprints with observed patterns of climate change for example, solar forcing can be ruled out as a major cause its fingerprint would be warming in the entire atmosphere yet, only the lower atmosphere has warmed, consistent with greenhouse gas forcing attribution of recent climate change shows that the main driver is elevated greenhouse gases, with aerosols having a dampening effect greenhouse gases are transparent to sunlight, and thus allow it to pass through the atmosphere to heat the earth\\'s surface the earth radiates it as heat, and greenhouse gases absorb a portion of it this absorption slows the rate at which heat escapes into space, trapping heat near the earth\\'s surface and warming it over time before the industrial revolution, naturally-occurring amounts of greenhouse gases caused the air near the surface to be about 33\\xa0°c warmer than it would have been in their absence while water vapour (~50%) and clouds (~25%) are the biggest contributors to the greenhouse effect, they increase as a function of temperature and are therefore feedbacks on the other hand, concentrations of gases such as co2 (~20%), tropospheric ozone, cfcs and nitrous oxide are not temperature-dependent, and are therefore external forcings human activity since the industrial revolution, mainly extracting and burning fossil fuels (coal, oil, and natural gas), has increased the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, resulting in a radiative imbalance in 2019, the concentrations of co2 and methane had increased by about 48% and 160%, respectively, since 1750 these co2 levels are higher than they have been at any time during the last 2 million years concentrations of methane are far higher than they were over the last 800,000 years global anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions in 2019 were equivalent to 59\\xa0billion tonnes of co2 of these emissions, 75% was co2, 18% was methane, 4% was nitrous oxide, and 2% was fluorinated gases co2 emissions primarily come from burning fossil fuels to provide energy for transport, manufacturing, heating, and electricity additional co2 emissions come from deforestation and industrial processes, which include the co2 released by the chemical reactions for making cement, steel, aluminum, and fertiliser methane emissions come from livestock, manure, rice cultivation, landfills, wastewater, and coal mining, as well as oil and gas extraction nitrous oxide emissions largely come from the microbial decomposition of fertiliser despite the contribution of deforestation to greenhouse gas emissions, the earth\\'s land surface, particularly its forests, remain a significant carbon sink for co2 land-surface sink processes, such as carbon fixation in the soil and photosynthesis, remove about 29% of annual global co2 emissions the ocean also serves as a significant carbon sink via a two-step process first, co2 dissolves in the surface water afterwards, the ocean\\'s overturning circulation distributes it deep into the ocean\\'s interior, where it accumulates over time as part of the carbon cycle over the last two decades, the world\\'s oceans have absorbed 20 to 30% of emitted co2 air pollution, in the form of aerosols, not only puts a large burden on human health, but also affects the climate on a large scale from 1961 to 1990, a gradual reduction in the amount of sunlight reaching the earth\\'s surface was observed, a phenomenon popularly known as global dimming, typically attributed to aerosols from biofuel and fossil fuel burning globally, aerosols have been declining since 1990, meaning that they no longer mask greenhouse gas warming as much aerosols scatter and absorb solar radiation they also have indirect effects on the earth\\'s radiation budget sulfate aerosols act as cloud condensation nuclei and lead to clouds that have more and smaller cloud droplets these clouds reflect solar radiation more efficiently than clouds with fewer and larger droplets they also reduce the growth of raindrops, which makes clouds more reflective to incoming sunlight indirect effects of aerosols are the largest uncertainty in radiative forcing while aerosols typically limit global warming by reflecting sunlight, black carbon in soot that falls on snow or ice can contribute to global warming not only does this increase the absorption of sunlight, it also increases melting and sea-level rise limiting new black carbon deposits in the arctic could reduce global warming by 0 2\\xa0°c by 2050 humans change the earth\\'s surface mainly to create more agricultural land today, agriculture takes up 34% of earth\\'s land area, while 26% is forests, and 30% is uninhabitable (glaciers, deserts, etc ) the amount of forested land continues to decrease, which is the main land use change that causes global warming deforestation releases co2 contained in trees when they are destroyed, plus it prevents those trees from absorbing more co2 in the future the main causes of deforestation are: permanent land-use change from forest to agricultural land producing products such as beef and palm oil (27%), logging to produce forestry/forest products (26%), short term shifting cultivation (24%), and wildfires (23%) land use changes not only affect greenhouse gas emissions the type of vegetation in a region affects the local temperature it impacts how much of the sunlight gets reflected back into space (albedo), and how much heat is lost by evaporation for instance, the change from a dark forest to grassland makes the surface lighter, causing it to reflect more sunlight deforestation can also affect temperatures by modifying the release of chemical compounds that influence clouds, and by changing wind patterns in tropic and temperate areas the net effect is to produce significant warming, while at latitudes closer to the poles a gain of albedo (as forest is replaced by snow cover) leads to a cooling effect globally, these effects are estimated to have led to a slight cooling, dominated by an increase in surface albedo physical climate models are unable to reproduce the rapid warming observed in recent decades when taking into account only variations in solar output and volcanic activity as the sun is the earth\\'s primary energy source, changes in incoming sunlight directly affect the climate system solar irradiance has been measured directly by satellites, and indirect measurements are available from the early 1600s onwards there has been no upward trend in the amount of the sun\\'s energy reaching the earth further evidence for greenhouse gases causing global warming comes from measurements that show a warming of the lower atmosphere (the troposphere), coupled with a cooling of the upper atmosphere (the stratosphere) if solar variations were responsible for the observed warming, the troposphere and stratosphere would both warm explosive volcanic eruptions represent the largest natural forcing over the industrial era when the eruption is sufficiently strong (with sulfur dioxide reaching the stratosphere), sunlight can be partially blocked for a couple of years the temperature signal lasts about twice as long in the industrial era, volcanic activity has had negligible impacts on global temperature trends present-day volcanic co2 emissions are equivalent to less than 1% of current anthropogenic co2 emissions the response of the climate system to an initial forcing is modified by feedbacks: increased by self-reinforcing feedbacks and reduced by balancing feedbacks the main reinforcing feedbacks are the water-vapour feedback, the ice–albedo feedback, and the net effect of clouds the primary balancing mechanism is radiative cooling, as earth\\'s surface gives off more heat to space in response to rising temperature in addition to temperature feedbacks, there are feedbacks in the carbon cycle, such as the fertilizing effect of co2 on plant growth uncertainty over feedbacks is the major reason why different climate models project different magnitudes of warming for a given amount of emissions as the air is warmed by greenhouse gases, it can hold more moisture water vapour is a potent greenhouse gas, so this further heats the atmosphere if cloud cover increases, more sunlight will be reflected back into space, cooling the planet if clouds become higher and thinner, they act as an insulator, reflecting heat from below back downwards and warming the planet the effect of clouds is the largest source of feedback uncertainty another major feedback is the reduction of snow cover and sea ice in the arctic, which reduces the reflectivity of the earth\\'s surface more of the sun\\'s energy is now absorbed in these regions, contributing to amplification of arctic temperature changes arctic amplification is also melting permafrost, which releases methane and co2 into the atmosphere climate change can also cause methane releases from wetlands, marine systems, and freshwater systems overall, climate feedbacks are expected to become increasingly positive around half of human-caused co2 emissions have been absorbed by land plants and by the oceans on land, elevated co2 and an extended growing season have stimulated plant growth climate change increases droughts and heat waves that inhibit plant growth, which makes it uncertain whether this carbon sink will continue to grow in the future soils contain large quantities of carbon and may release some when they heat up as more co2 and heat are absorbed by the ocean, it acidifies, its circulation changes and phytoplankton takes up less carbon, decreasing the rate at which the ocean absorbs atmospheric carbon overall, at higher co2 concentrations the earth will absorb a reduced fraction of our emissions a climate model is a representation of the physical, chemical, and biological processes that affect the climate system models are used to calculate the degree of warming future emissions will cause when accounting for the strength of climate feedbacks models also include natural processes like changes in the earth\\'s orbit, historical changes in the sun\\'s activity, and volcanic forcing in addition to estimating future temperatures, they reproduce and predict the circulation of the oceans, the annual cycle of the seasons, and the flows of carbon between the land surface and the atmosphere the physical realism of models is tested by examining their ability to simulate contemporary or past climates past models have underestimated the rate of arctic shrinkage and underestimated the rate of precipitation increase sea level rise since 1990 was underestimated in older models, but more recent models agree well with observations the 2017 united states-published national climate assessment notes that \"climate models may still be underestimating or missing relevant feedback processes\" a subset of climate models add societal factors to a simple physical climate model these models simulate how population, economic growth, and energy use affect\\xa0– and interact with\\xa0– the physical climate with this information, these models can produce scenarios of future greenhouse gas emissions this is then used as input for physical climate models and carbon cycle models to predict how atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases might change in the future depending on the socioeconomic scenario and the mitigation scenario, models produce atmospheric co2 concentrations that range widely between 380 and 1400 ppm the ipcc sixth assessment report projects that global warming is very likely to reach 1 0\\xa0°c to 1 8\\xa0°c by the late 21st century under the very low ghg emissions scenario in an intermediate scenario global warming would reach 2 1\\xa0°c to 3 5\\xa0°c, and 3 3\\xa0°c to 5 7\\xa0°c under the very high ghg emissions scenario these projections are based on climate models in combination with observations the remaining carbon budget is determined by modelling the carbon cycle and the climate sensitivity to greenhouse gases according to the ipcc, global warming can be kept below 1 5\\xa0°c with a two-thirds chance if emissions after 2018 do not exceed 420 or 570 gigatonnes of co2 this corresponds to 10 to 13 years of current emissions there are high uncertainties about the budget for instance, it may be 100 gigatonnes of co2 smaller due to methane release from permafrost and wetlands however, it is clear that fossil fuel resources are too abundant for shortages to be relied on to limit carbon emissions in the 21st century the environmental effects of climate change are broad and far-reaching, affecting oceans, ice, and weather changes may occur gradually or rapidly evidence for these effects comes from studying climate change in the past, from modelling, and from modern observations since the 1950s, droughts and heat waves have appeared simultaneously with increasing frequency extremely wet or dry events within the monsoon period have increased in india and east asia the rainfall rate and intensity of hurricanes and typhoons is likely increasing frequency of tropical cyclones has not increased as a result of climate change however, a study review article published in 2021 in nature geoscience concluded that the geographic range of tropical cyclones will probably expand poleward in response to climate warming of the hadley circulation global sea level is rising as a consequence of glacial melt, melt of the ice sheets in greenland and antarctica, and thermal expansion between 1993 and 2020, the rise increased over time, averaging 3 3\\xa0±\\xa00 3\\xa0mm per year over the 21st century, the ipcc projects that in a very high emissions scenario the sea level could rise by 61–110\\xa0cm increased ocean warmth is undermining and threatening to unplug antarctic glacier outlets, risking a large melt of the ice sheet and the possibility of a 2-meter sea level rise by 2100 under high emissions climate change has led to decades of shrinking and thinning of the arctic sea ice while ice-free summers are expected to be rare at 1 5\\xa0°c degrees of warming, they are set to occur once every three to ten years at a warming level of 2\\xa0°c higher atmospheric co2 concentrations have led to changes in ocean chemistry an increase in dissolved co2 is causing oceans to acidify in addition, oxygen levels are decreasing as oxygen is less soluble in warmer water dead zones in the ocean, regions with very little oxygen, are expanding too greater degrees of global warming increase the risk of passing through ‘tipping points’—thresholds beyond which certain impacts can no longer be avoided even if temperatures are reduced an example is the collapse of west antarctic and greenland ice sheets, where a temperature rise of 1 5 to 2\\xa0°c may commit the ice sheets to melt, although the time scale of melt is uncertain and depends on future warming some large-scale changes could occur over a short time period, such as a shutdown of certain ocean currents like the atlantic meridional overturning circulation (amoc) tipping points can also include irreversible damage to ecosystems like the amazon rainforest and coral reefs the long-term effects of climate change include further ice melt, ocean warming, sea level rise, and ocean acidification on the timescale of centuries to millennia, the magnitude of climate change will be determined primarily by anthropogenic co2 emissions this is due to co2\\'s long atmospheric lifetime oceanic co2 uptake is slow enough that ocean acidification will continue for hundreds to thousands of years these emissions are estimated to have prolonged the current interglacial period by at least 100,000 years sea level rise will continue over many centuries, with an estimated rise of 2 3 metres per degree celsius (4 2\\xa0ft/°f) after 2000 years recent warming has driven many terrestrial and freshwater species poleward and towards higher altitudes higher atmospheric co2 levels and an extended growing season have resulted in global greening however, heatwaves and drought have reduced ecosystem productivity in some regions the future balance of these opposing effects is unclear climate change has contributed to the expansion of drier climate zones, such as the expansion of deserts in the subtropics the size and speed of global warming is making abrupt changes in ecosystems more likely overall, it is expected that climate change will result in the extinction of many species the oceans have heated more slowly than the land, but plants and animals in the ocean have migrated towards the colder poles faster than species on land just as on land, heat waves in the ocean occur more frequently due to climate change, harming a wide range of organisms such as corals, kelp, and seabirds ocean acidification makes it harder for organisms such as mussels, barnacles and corals to produce shells and skeletons; and heatwaves have bleached coral reefs harmful algal blooms enhanced by climate change and eutrophication lower oxygen levels, disrupt food webs and cause great loss of marine life coastal ecosystems are under particular stress almost half of global wetlands have disappeared due to climate change and other human impacts ecological collapse bleaching has damaged the great barrier reef and threatens reefs worldwide extreme weather drought and high temperatures worsened the 2020 bushfires in australia arctic warming permafrost thaws undermine infrastructure and release methane, a greenhouse gas habitat destruction many arctic animals rely on sea ice, which has been disappearing in a warming arctic pest propagation mild winters allow more pine beetles to survive to kill large swaths of forest the effects of climate change on humans have been observed worldwide they are mostly due to warming and shifts in precipitation impacts can now be observed on all continents and ocean regions, with low-latitude, less developed areas facing the greatest risk continued warming has potentially “severe, pervasive and irreversible impacts” for people and ecosystems the risks are unevenly distributed, but are generally greater for disadvantaged people in developing and developed countries the who has classified climate change as the greatest threat to global health in the 21st century extreme weather leads to injury and loss of life, and crop failures to undernutrition various infectious diseases are more easily transmitted in a warmer climate, such as dengue fever and malaria young children are the most vulnerable to food shortages both children and older people are vulnerable to extreme heat the world health organization (who) has estimated that between 2030 and 2050, climate change would cause around 250,000 additional deaths per year they assessed deaths from heat exposure in elderly people, increases in diarrhea, malaria, dengue, coastal flooding, and childhood undernutrition over 500,000 more adult deaths are projected yearly by 2050 due to reductions in food availability and quality climate change is affecting food security it has caused reduction in global yields of maize, wheat, and soybeans between 1981 and 2010 future warming could further reduce global yields of major crops crop production will probably be negatively affected in low-latitude countries, while effects at northern latitudes may be positive or negative up to an additional 183 million people worldwide, particularly those with lower incomes, are at risk of hunger as a consequence of these impacts climate change also impacts fish populations globally, less will be available to be fished regions dependent on glacier water, regions that are already dry, and small islands have a higher risk of water stress due to climate change economic damages due to climate change may be severe and there is a chance of disastrous consequences climate change has likely already increased global economic inequality, and this trend is projected to continue most of the severe impacts are expected in sub-saharan africa, where most of the local inhabitants are dependent upon natural and agricultural resources, and south-east asia the world bank estimates that climate change could drive over 120 million people into poverty by 2030 current inequalities based on wealth and social status have worsened due to climate change major difficulties in mitigating, adapting, and recovering to climate shocks are faced by marginalized people who have less control over resources indigenous people, who are subsistent on their land and ecosystems, will face endangerment to their wellness and lifestyles due to climate change an expert elicitation concluded that the role of climate change in armed conflict has been small compared to factors such as socio-economic inequality and state capabilities low-lying islands and coastal communities are threatened by sea level rise, which makes flooding more common sometimes, land is permanently lost to the sea this could lead to statelessness for people in island nations, such as the maldives and tuvalu in some regions, the rise in temperature and humidity may be too severe for humans to adapt to with worst-case climate change, models project that almost one-third of humanity might live in extremely hot and uninhabitable climates, similar to the current climate found in the sahara these factors can drive environmental migration, both within and between countries more people are expected to be displaced because of sea level rise, extreme weather and conflict from increased competition over natural resources climate change may also increase vulnerability, leading to \"trapped populations\" who are not able to move due to a lack of resources environmental migration sparser rainfall leads to desertification that harms agriculture and can displace populations shown: telly, mali (2008) agricultural changes droughts, rising temperatures, and extreme weather negatively impact agriculture shown: texas, us (2013) tidal flooding sea-level rise increases flooding in low-lying coastal regions shown: venice, italy (2004) storm intensification bangladesh after cyclone sidr (2007) is an example of catastrophic flooding from increased rainfall heat wave intensification events like the june 2019 european heat wave are becoming more common climate change can be mitigated by reducing greenhouse gas emissions and by enhancing sinks that absorb greenhouse gases from the atmosphere in order to limit global warming to less than 1 5\\xa0°c with a high likelihood of success, global greenhouse gas emissions needs to be net-zero by 2050, or by 2070 with a 2\\xa0°c target this requires far-reaching, systemic changes on an unprecedented scale in energy, land, cities, transport, buildings, and industry the united nations environment programme estimates that countries need to triple their pledges under the paris agreement within the next decade to limit global warming to 2\\xa0°c an even greater level of reduction is required to meet the 1 5\\xa0°c goal with pledges made under the agreement as of october 2021, global warming would still have a 66% chance of reaching about 2 7\\xa0°c (range: 2 2–3 2\\xa0°c) by the end of the century although there is no single pathway to limit global warming to 1 5 or 2\\xa0°c, most scenarios and strategies see a major increase in the use of renewable energy in combination with increased energy efficiency measures to generate the needed greenhouse gas reductions to reduce pressures on ecosystems and enhance their carbon sequestration capabilities, changes would also be necessary in agriculture and forestry, such as preventing deforestation and restoring natural ecosystems by reforestation other approaches to mitigating climate change have a higher level of risk scenarios that limit global warming to 1 5\\xa0°c typically project the large-scale use of carbon dioxide removal methods over the 21st century there are concerns, though, about over-reliance on these technologies, and environmental impacts solar radiation management (srm) is also a possible supplement to deep reductions in emissions however, srm would raise significant ethical and legal issues, and the risks are poorly understood renewable energy is key to limiting climate change fossil fuels accounted for 80% of the world\\'s energy in 2018 the remaining share was split between nuclear power and renewables (including hydropower, bioenergy,  wind and solar power and geothermal energy) that mix is projected to change significantly over the next 30 years solar panels and onshore wind are now among the cheapest forms of adding new power generation capacity in many locations renewables represented 75% of all new electricity generation installed in 2019, nearly all solar and wind other forms of clean energy, such as nuclear and hydropower, currently have a larger share of the energy supply however, their future growth forecasts appear limited in comparison to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050, renewable energy would become the dominant form of electricity generation, rising to 85% or more by 2050 in some scenarios investment in coal would be eliminated and coal use nearly phased out by 2050 electricity would also need to become the main energy source for heating and transport in transport, emissions can be reduced fast by a switch to electric vehicles public transport and active transport (cycling and walking) also produce less co2 for shipping and flying, low-carbon fuels can be used to reduce emissions heating would be increasingly decarbonised with technologies like heat pumps there are obstacles to the continued rapid growth of clean energy, including renewables for wind and solar, there are environmental and land use concerns for new projects wind and solar also produce energy intermittently and with seasonal variability traditionally, hydro dams with reservoirs and conventional power plants have been used when variable energy production is low going forward, battery storage can be expanded, energy demand and supply can be matched, and long-distance transmission can smooth variability of renewable outputs bioenergy is often not carbon-neutral and may have negative consequences for food security the growth of nuclear power is constrained by controversy around nuclear waste, nuclear weapon proliferation, and accidents hydropower growth is limited by the fact that the best sites have been developed, and new projects are confronting increased social and environmental concerns low-carbon energy improves human health by minimising climate change it also has the near-term benefit of reducing air pollution deaths, which were estimated at 7 million annually in 2016 meeting the paris agreement goals that limit warming to a 2\\xa0°c increase could save about a million of those lives per year by 2050, whereas limiting global warming to 1 5\\xa0°c could save millions and simultaneously increase energy security and reduce poverty reducing energy demand is another major aspect of reducing emissions if less energy is needed, there is more flexibility for clean energy development it also makes it easier to manage the electricity grid, and minimises carbon-intensive infrastructure development major increases in energy efficiency investment will be required to achieve climate goals, comparable to the level of investment in renewable energy several covid-19 related changes in energy use patterns, energy efficiency investments, and funding have made forecasts for this decade more difficult and uncertain strategies to reduce energy demand vary by sector in transport, passengers and freight can switch to more efficient travel modes, such as buses and trains, or use electric vehicles industrial strategies to reduce energy demand include improving heating systems and motors, designing less energy-intensive products, and increasing product lifetimes in the building sector the focus is on better design of new buildings, and higher levels of energy efficiency in retrofitting the use of technologies like heat pumps can also increase building energy efficiency agriculture and forestry face a triple challenge of limiting greenhouse gas emissions, preventing the further conversion of forests to agricultural land, and meeting increases in world food demand a set of actions could reduce agriculture and forestry-based emissions by two thirds from 2010 levels these include reducing growth in demand for food and other agricultural products, increasing land productivity, protecting and restoring forests, and reducing greenhouse gas emissions from agricultural production on the demand side, a key component of reducing emissions is shifting people towards plant-based diets eliminating the production of livestock for meat and dairy would eliminate about 3/4ths of all emissions from agriculture and other land use livestock also occupy 37% of ice-free land area on earth and consume feed from the 12% of land area used for crops, driving deforestation and land degradation steel and cement production are responsible for about 13% of industrial co2 emissions in these industries, carbon-intensive materials such as coke and lime play an integral role in the production, so that reducing co2 emissions requires research into alternative chemistries natural carbon sinks can be enhanced to sequester significantly larger amounts of co2 beyond naturally occurring levels reforestation and tree planting on non-forest lands are among the most mature sequestration techniques, although the latter raises food security concerns farmers can promote sequestration of  carbon in soils through practices such as use of winter cover crops, reducing the intensity and frequency of tillage, and using compost and manure as soil amendments restoration/recreation of coastal wetlands and seagrass meadows increases the uptake of carbon into organic matter (blue carbon) when carbon is sequestered in soils and in organic matter such as trees, there is a risk of the carbon being re-released into the atmosphere later through changes in land use, fire, or other changes in ecosystems where energy production or co2-intensive heavy industries continue to produce waste co2, the gas can be captured and stored instead of released to the atmosphere although its current use is limited in scale and expensive, carbon capture and storage (ccs) may be able to play a significant role in limiting co2 emissions by mid-century this technique, in combination with bio-energy (beccs) can result in net negative emissions: co2 is drawn from the atmosphere it remains highly uncertain whether carbon dioxide removal techniques, such as beccs, will be able to play a large role in limiting warming to 1 5\\xa0°c policy decisions that rely on carbon dioxide removal increase the risk of global warming rising beyond international goals adaptation is \"the process of adjustment to current or expected changes in climate and its effects\" without additional mitigation, adaptation cannot avert the risk of \"severe, widespread and irreversible\" impacts more severe climate change requires more transformative adaptation, which can be prohibitively expensive the capacity and potential for humans to adapt is unevenly distributed across different regions and populations, and developing countries generally have less the first two decades of the 21st century saw an increase in adaptive capacity in most low- and middle-income countries with improved access to basic sanitation and electricity, but progress is slow many countries have implemented adaptation policies however, there is a considerable gap between necessary and available finance adaptation to sea level rise consists of avoiding at-risk areas, learning to live with increased flooding and protection if that fails, managed retreat may be needed there are economic barriers for tackling dangerous heat impact avoiding strenuous work or having air conditioning is not possible for everybody in agriculture, adaptation options include a switch to more sustainable diets, diversification, erosion control and genetic improvements for increased tolerance to a changing climate insurance allows for risk-sharing, but is often difficult to get for people on lower incomes education, migration and early warning systems can reduce climate vulnerability ecosystems adapt to climate change, a process that can be supported by human intervention by increasing connectivity between ecosystems, species can migrate to more favourable climate conditions species can also be introduced to areas acquiring a favorable climate protection and restoration of natural and semi-natural areas helps build resilience, making it easier for ecosystems to adapt many of the actions that promote adaptation in ecosystems, also help humans adapt via ecosystem-based adaptation for instance, restoration of natural fire regimes makes catastrophic fires less likely, and reduces human exposure giving rivers more space allows for more water storage in the natural system, reducing flood risk restored forest acts as a carbon sink, but planting trees in unsuitable regions can exacerbate climate impacts there are synergies and trade-offs between adaptation and mitigation adaptation often offer short-term benefits, whereas mitigation has longer-term benefits increased use of air conditioning allows people to better cope with heat, but increases energy demand compact urban development may lead to reduced emissions from transport and construction at the same time, it may increase the urban heat island effect, leading to higher temperatures and increased exposure increased food productivity has large benefits for both adaptation and mitigation countries that are most vulnerable to climate change have typically been responsible for a small share of global emissions this raises questions about justice and fairness climate change is strongly linked to sustainable development limiting global warming makes it easier to achieve sustainable development goals, such as eradicating poverty and reducing inequalities the connection is recognised in sustainable development goal 13 which is to \"take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts\" the goals on food, clean water and ecosystem protection have synergies with climate mitigation the geopolitics of climate change is complex it has often been framed as a free-rider problem, in which all countries benefit from mitigation done by other countries, but individual countries would lose from switching to a low-carbon economy themselves this framing has been challenged for instance, the benefits of a coal phase-out to public health and local environments exceed the costs in almost all regions furthermore, net importers of fossil fuels win economically from switching to clean energy, causing net exporters to face stranded assets: fossil fuels they cannot sell a wide range of policies, regulations, and laws are being used to reduce emissions as of 2019, carbon pricing covers about 20% of global greenhouse gas emissions carbon can be priced with carbon taxes and emissions trading systems direct global fossil fuel subsidies reached $319 billion in 2017, and $5 2 trillion when indirect costs such as air pollution are priced in ending these can cause a 28% reduction in global carbon emissions and a 46% reduction in air pollution deaths subsidies could be used to support the transition to clean energy instead more direct methods to reduce greenhouse gases include vehicle efficiency standards, renewable fuel standards, and air pollution regulations on heavy industry several countries require utilities to increase the share of renewables in power production policy designed through the lens of climate justice tries to address human rights issues and social inequality for instance, wealthy nations responsible for the largest share of emissions would have to pay poorer countries to adapt as the use of fossil fuels is reduced, jobs in the sector are being lost to achieve a just transition, these people would need to be retrained for other jobs communities with many fossil fuel workers would need additional investments nearly all countries in the world are parties to the 1994 united nations framework convention on climate change (unfccc) the goal of the unfccc is to prevent dangerous human interference with the climate system as stated in the convention, this requires that greenhouse gas concentrations are stabilised in the atmosphere at a level where ecosystems can adapt naturally to climate change, food production is not threatened, and economic development can be sustained the unfccc does not itself restrict emissions but rather provides a framework for protocols that do global emissions have risen since the unfccc was signed its yearly conferences are the stage of global negotiations the 1997 kyoto protocol extended the unfccc and included legally binding commitments for most developed countries to limit their emissions during the negotiations, the g77 (representing developing countries) pushed for a mandate requiring developed countries to \"[take] the lead\" in reducing their emissions, since developed countries contributed most to the accumulation of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere per-capita emissions were also still relatively low in developing countries and developing countries would need to emit more to meet their development needs the 2009 copenhagen accord has been widely portrayed as disappointing because of its low goals, and was rejected by poorer nations including the g77 associated parties aimed to limit the global temperature rise to below 2\\xa0°c the accord set the goal of sending $100 billion per year to developing countries for mitigation and adaptation by 2020, and proposed the founding of the green climate fund as of 2020[update], the fund has failed to reach its expected target, and risks a shrinkage in its funding in 2015 all un countries negotiated the paris agreement, which aims to keep global warming well below 2 0\\xa0°c and contains an aspirational goal of keeping warming under 1 5\\xa0°c the agreement replaced the kyoto protocol unlike kyoto, no binding emission targets were set in the paris agreement instead, a set of procedures was made binding countries have to regularly set ever more ambitious goals and reevaluate these goals every five years the paris agreement restated that developing countries must be financially supported as of october 2021[update], 194 states and the european union have signed the treaty and 191 states and the eu have ratified or acceded to the agreement the 1987 montreal protocol, an international agreement to stop emitting ozone-depleting gases, may have been more effective at curbing greenhouse gas emissions than the kyoto protocol specifically designed to do so the 2016 kigali amendment to the montreal protocol aims to reduce the emissions of hydrofluorocarbons, a group of powerful greenhouse gases which served as a replacement for banned ozone-depleting gases this made the montreal protocol a stronger agreement against climate change in 2019, the united kingdom parliament became the first national government to declare a climate emergency other countries and jurisdictions followed suit that same year, the european parliament declared a \"climate and environmental emergency\" the european commission presented its european green deal with the goal of making the eu carbon-neutral by 2050 major countries in asia have made similar pledges: south korea and japan have committed to become carbon-neutral by 2050, and china by 2060 in 2021, the european commission released its “fit for 55” legislation package, which contains guidelines for the car industry; all new cars on the european market must be zero-emission vehicles from 2035 while india has strong incentives for renewables, it also plans a significant expansion of coal in the country as of 2021, based on information from 48 national climate plans, which represent 40% of the parties to the paris agreement, estimated total greenhouse gas emissions will be 0 5% lower compared to 2010 levels, below the 45% or 25% reduction goals to limit global warming to 1 5\\xa0°c or 2\\xa0°c, respectively there is a near-complete scientific consensus that the climate is warming and that this is caused by human activities as of 2019, agreement in recent literature reached over 99% no scientific body of national or international standing disagrees with this view consensus has further developed that some form of action should be taken to protect people against the impacts of climate change national science academies have called on world leaders to cut global emissions scientific discussion takes place in journal articles that are peer-reviewed scientists assess these every few years in the intergovernmental panel on climate change reports the 2021 ipcc assessment report stated that it is \"unequivocal\" that climate change is caused by humans public debate about climate change has been strongly affected by climate change denial and misinformation, which originated in the united states and has since spread to other countries, particularly canada and australia the actors behind climate change denial form a well-funded and relatively coordinated coalition of fossil fuel companies, industry groups, conservative think tanks, and contrarian scientists like the tobacco industry, the main strategy of these groups has been to manufacture doubt about scientific data and results many who deny, dismiss, or hold unwarranted doubt about the scientific consensus on anthropogenic climate change are labelled as \"climate change skeptics\", which several scientists have noted is a misnomer there are different variants of climate denial: some deny that warming takes place at all, some acknowledge warming but attribute it to natural influences, and some minimise the negative impacts of climate change manufacturing uncertainty about the science later developed into a manufactured controversy: creating the belief that there is significant uncertainty about climate change within the scientific community in order to delay policy changes strategies to promote these ideas include criticism of scientific institutions, and questioning the motives of individual scientists an echo chamber of climate-denying blogs and media has further fomented misunderstanding of climate change climate change came to international public attention in the late 1980s due to media coverage in the early 1990s, people often confused climate change with other environmental issues like ozone depletion in popular culture, the  climate fiction movie the day after tomorrow (2004) and the al gore documentary an inconvenient truth (2006) focused on climate change significant regional, gender, age and political differences exist in both public concern for, and understanding of, climate change more highly educated people, and in some countries, women and younger people, were more likely to see climate change as a serious threat partisan gaps also exist in many countries, and countries with high co2 emissions tend to be less concerned views on causes of climate change vary widely between countries concern has increased over time, to the point where in 2021 a majority of citizens in many countries express a high level of worry about climate change, or view it as a global emergency higher levels of worry are associated with stronger public support for policies that address climate change climate protests demand that political leaders take action to prevent climate change they can take the form of public demonstrations, fossil fuel divestment, lawsuits and other activities prominent demonstrations include the school strike for climate in this initiative, young people across the globe have been protesting since 2018 by skipping school on fridays, inspired by swedish teenager greta thunberg mass civil disobedience actions by groups like extinction rebellion have protested by disrupting roads and public transport litigation is increasingly used as a tool to strengthen climate action from public institutions and companies activists also initiate lawsuits which target governments and demand that they take ambitious action or enforce existing laws on climate change lawsuits against fossil-fuel companies generally seek compensation for loss and damage in the 1820s, joseph fourier proposed the greenhouse effect to explain why earth\\'s temperature was higher than the sun\\'s energy alone could explain earth\\'s atmosphere is transparent to sunlight, so sunlight reaches the surface where it is converted to heat however, the atmosphere is not transparent to heat radiating from the surface, and captures some of that heat which warms the planet in 1856 eunice newton foote demonstrated that the warming effect of the sun is greater for air with water vapour than for dry air, and the effect is even greater with carbon dioxide she concluded that \"an atmosphere of that gas would give to our earth a high temperature   \" starting in 1859, john tyndall established that nitrogen and oxygen—together totalling 99% of dry air—are transparent to radiated heat however, water vapour and some gases (in particular methane and carbon dioxide) absorb radiated heat and re-radiate that heat within the atmosphere tyndall proposed that changes in the concentrations of these gases may have caused climatic changes in the past, including ice ages svante arrhenius noted that water vapour in air continuously varied, but the co2 concentration in air was influenced by long-term geological processes at the end of an ice age, warming from increased co2 levels would increase the amount of water vapour, amplifying warming in a feedback loop in 1896, he published the first climate model of its kind, showing that halving of co2 levels could have produced the drop in temperature initiating the ice age arrhenius calculated the temperature increase expected from doubling co2 to be around 5–6\\xa0°c other scientists were initially sceptical and believed the greenhouse effect to be saturated so that adding more co2 would make no difference they thought climate would be self-regulating from 1938 onwards guy stewart callendar published evidence that climate was warming and co2 levels rising, but his calculations met the same objections in the 1950s, gilbert plass created a detailed computer model that included different atmospheric layers and the infrared spectrum this model predicted that increasing co2 levels would cause warming around the same time, hans suess found evidence that co2 levels had been rising, and roger revelle showed that the oceans would not absorb the increase the two scientists subsequently helped charles keeling to begin a record of continued increase, which has been termed the \"keeling curve\" scientists alerted the public, and the dangers were highlighted at james hansen\\'s 1988 congressional testimony the intergovernmental panel on climate change, set up in 1988 to provide formal advice to the world\\'s governments, spurred interdisciplinary research fourth assessment reportfifth assessment reportspecial report: global warming of 1 5\\xa0°cspecial report: climate change and landspecial report: the ocean and cryosphere in a changing climatesixth assessment reportgreenhouse gas emissions from human activities strengthen the greenhouse effect, causing climate change most is carbon dioxide from burning fossil fuels: coal, oil, and natural gas the largest emitters include coal in china and large oil and gas companies, many state-owned by opec and russia human-caused emissions have increased atmospheric carbon dioxide by about 50% over pre-industrial levels the growing levels of emissions have varied, but it was consistent among all greenhouse gases emissions in the 2010s averaged 56 billion tons a year,  higher than ever before electricity generation and transport are major emitters, the largest single source being coal-fired power stations with 20% of ghg deforestation and other changes in land use also emit carbon dioxide and methane the largest source of anthropogenic methane emissions is agriculture, closely followed by gas venting and fugitive emissions from the fossil-fuel industry the largest agricultural methane source is livestock agricultural soils emit nitrous oxide partly due to fertilizers similarly, fluorinated gases from refrigerants play an outsized role in total human emissions at current emission rates averaging six and a half tonnes per person per year, before 2030 temperatures may have increased by 1 5\\xa0°c (2 7 °f) over pre-industrial levels, which is the limit for the g7 countries and aspirational limit of the paris agreement global greenhouse gas emissions are about 50 gt per year (6 6t per person) and for 2019 have been estimated at 57 gt co2 eq including 5 gt due to land use change in 2019, approximately 34% [20 gtco2-eq] of total net anthropogenic ghg emissions came from the energy supply sector, 24% [14 gtco2-eq] from industry, 22% [13 gtco2-eq]from agriculture, forestry and other land use (afolu), 15% [8 7 gtco2-eq] from transport and 6% [3 3 gtco2-eq] from buildings carbon dioxide (co2), nitrous oxide (n2o), methane, three groups of fluorinated gases (sulfur hexafluoride (sf6), hydrofluorocarbons (hfcs) and perfluorocarbons (pfcs)) are the major anthropogenic greenhouse gases, and are regulated under the paris agreement :\\u200a147\\u200aalthough cfcs are greenhouse gases, they are regulated by the montreal protocol, which was motivated by cfcs\\' contribution to ozone depletion rather than by their contribution to global warming note that ozone depletion has only a minor role in greenhouse warming, though the two processes are sometimes confused in the media in 2016, negotiators from over 170 nations meeting at the summit of the united nations environment programme reached a legally binding accord to phase out hydrofluorocarbons (hfcs) in the kigali amendment to the montreal protocol there are several ways of measuring greenhouse gas emissions some variables that have been reported include:these measures are sometimes used by countries to assert various policy/ethical positions on climate change :\\u200a94\\u200athe use of different measures leads to a lack of comparability, which is problematic when monitoring progress towards targets there are arguments for the adoption of a common measurement tool, or at least the development of communication between different tools emissions may be tracked over long time periods, known as historical or cumulative emissions measurements cumulative emissions provide some indicators of what is responsible for greenhouse gas atmospheric concentration build-up :\\u200a199\\u200athe national accounts balance tracks emissions based on the difference between a country\\'s exports and imports for many richer nations, the balance is negative because more goods are imported than they are exported this result is mostly due to the fact that it is cheaper to produce goods outside of developed countries, leading developed countries to become increasingly dependent on services and not goods a positive account balance would mean that more production was occurring within a country, so more operational factories would increase carbon emission levels emissions may also be measured across shorter time periods emissions changes may, for example, be measured against the base year of 1990 1990 was used in the united nations framework convention on climate change (unfccc) as the base year for emissions, and is also used in the kyoto protocol (some gases are also measured from the year 1995) :\\u200a146,\\u200a149\\u200a a country\\'s emissions may also be reported as a proportion of global emissions for a particular year another measurement is of per capita emissions this divides a country\\'s total annual emissions by its mid-year population :\\u200a370\\u200a per capita emissions may be based on historical or annual emissions :\\u200a106–107\\u200awhile cities are sometimes considered to be disproportionate contributors to emissions, per-capita emissions tend to be lower for cities than the averages in their countries at current emission rates, before 2030 temperatures may have increased by 1 5\\xa0°c (2 7 °f) over pre-industrial levels, which is the limit for the g7 countries and aspirational limit of the paris agreement since about 1750, human activity has increased the concentration of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases as of 2021, measured atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide were almost 50% higher than pre-industrial levels natural sources of carbon dioxide are more than 20 times greater than sources due to human activity, but over periods longer than a few years natural sources are closely balanced by natural sinks, mainly photosynthesis of carbon compounds by plants and marine plankton absorption of terrestrial infrared radiation by longwave absorbing gases makes earth a less efficient emitter therefore, in order for earth to emit as much energy as is absorbed, global temperatures must increase burning fossil fuels is estimated to have emitted 62% of 2015 human ghg the largest single source is coal-fired power stations, with 20% of ghg as of 2021 the main sources of greenhouse gases due to human activity are:the seven sources of co2 from fossil fuel combustion are (with percentage contributions for 2000–2004):this list needs updating, as it uses an out-of-date source see the 2019 ipcc report for newer data [needs update]the largest source of anthropogenic methane emissions is agriculture, closely followed by gas venting and fugitive emissions from the fossil-fuel industry the largest agricultural methane source is livestock agricultural soils emit nitrous oxide partly due to fertilizers the major sources of greenhouse gases (ghg) are: a 2017 survey of corporations responsible for global emissions found that 100 companies were responsible for 71% of global direct and indirect emissions, and that state-owned companies were responsible for 59% of their emissions fueled by the consumptive lifestyle of wealthy people, the wealthiest 5% of the global population has been responsible for 37% of the absolute increase in greenhouse gas emissions worldwide almost half of the increase in absolute global emissions has been caused by the richest 10% of the population in the newest report from the ipcc 2022, it states that the lifestyle consumptions of the poor and middle class in emerging economies produce approximately 5-50 times less the amount that the high class in already developed high-income countries variations in regional, and national per capita emissions partly reflect different development stages, but they also vary widely at similar income levels the 10% of households with the highest per capita emissions contribute a disproportionately large share of global household ghg emissions 1 see also environmental impact of reservoirs#greenhouse gases list of acronyms:one liter of gasoline, when used as a fuel, produces 2 32 kg (about 1300 liters or 1 3 cubic meters) of carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas one us gallon produces 19 4\\xa0lb (1,291 5 gallons or 172 65 cubic feet) the mass of carbon dioxide that is released when one mj of energy is released from fuel can be estimated to a good approximation for the chemical formula of diesel we use as an approximation cnh2n note that diesel is a mixture of different molecules as carbon has a molar mass of 12 g/mol and hydrogen (atomic!) has a molar mass of about 1 g/mol, so the fraction by weight of carbon in diesel is roughly 12/14 the reaction of diesel combustion is given by:2cnh2n + 3no2 ⇌ 2nco2 + 2nh2ocarbon dioxide has a molar mass of 44g/mol as it consists of 2 atoms of oxygen (16 g/mol) and 1 atom of carbon (12 g/mol) so 12 g of carbon yield 44 g of carbon dioxide diesel has an energy content of 42 6 mj per kg or 23 47 gram of diesel contain 1 mj of energy putting everything together the mass of carbon dioxide that is produced by releasing 1mj of energy from diesel fuel can be calculated as:23 47\\xa0g\\xa0(diesel)/mj⋅1214⋅4412=74\\xa0g\\xa0(carbon dioxide)/mj{\\\\displaystyle 23 47\\\\ \\\\mathrm {g} {\\\\text{ (diesel)}}/\\\\mathrm {mj} \\\\cdot {\\\\frac

greenhouse gas emissions can be attributed to different sectors of the economy this provides a picture of the varying contributions of different types of economic activity to global warming, and helps in understanding the changes required to mitigate climate change manmade greenhouse gas emissions can be divided into those that arise from the combustion of fuels to produce energy, and those generated by other processes around two thirds of greenhouse gas emissions arise from the combustion of fuels energy may be produced at the point of consumption, or by a generator for consumption by others thus emissions arising from energy production may be categorized according to where they are emitted, or where the resulting energy is consumed if emissions are attributed at the point of production, then electricity generators contribute about 25% of global greenhouse gas emissions if these emissions are attributed to the final consumer then 24% of total emissions arise from manufacturing and construction, 17% from transportation, 11% from domestic consumers, and 7% from commercial consumers around 4% of emissions arise from the energy consumed by the energy and fuel industry itself the remaining third of emissions arise from processes other than energy production 12% of total emissions arise from agriculture, 7% from land use change and forestry, 6% from industrial processes, and 3% from waste around 6% of emissions are fugitive emissions, which are waste gases released by the extraction of fossil fuels as of 2020[update] secunda ctl is the world\\'s largest single emitter, at 56 5 million tonnes co2 a year agriculture contributes towards climate change through greenhouse gas emissions and by the conversion of non-agricultural land such as forests into agricultural land in 2019 the ipcc reported that 13%-21% of anthropogenic greenhouse gasses came specifically from the agriculture, forestry, and other land uses sector (afolu) emissions from agriculture of nitrous oxide, methane and carbon dioxide make up to half of the greenhouse-gases produced by the overall food industry, or 80% of agricultural emissions animal husbandry is a major source of greenhouse gas emissions the agricultural food system is responsible for a significant amount of greenhouse gas emissions in addition to being a significant user of land and consumer of fossil fuel, agriculture contributes directly to greenhouse gas emissions through practices such as rice production and the raising of livestock the three main causes of the increase in greenhouse gases observed over the past 250 years have been fossil fuels, land use, and agriculture farm animal digestive systems can be put into two categories: monogastric and ruminant ruminant cattle for beef and dairy rank high in greenhouse-gas emissions; monogastric, or pigs and poultry-related foods, are low the consumption of the monogastric types may yield less emissions monogastric animals have a higher feed-conversion efficiency, and also do not produce as much methane approximately 3 5% of the overall human impacts on climate are from the aviation sector the impact of the sector on climate in the late 20 years had doubled, but the part of the contribution of the sector in comparison to other sectors did not change because other sectors grew as well in 2018, manufacturing construction materials and maintaining buildings accounted for 39% of carbon dioxide emissions from energy and process-related emissions manufacture of glass, cement, and steel accounted for 11% of energy and process-related emissions because building construction is a significant investment, more than two-thirds of buildings in existence will still exist in 2050 retrofitting existing buildings to become more efficient will be necessary to meet the targets of the paris agreement; it will be insufficient to only apply low-emission standards to new construction buildings that produce as much energy as they consume are called zero-energy buildings, while buildings that produce more than they consume are energy-plus low-energy buildings are designed to be highly efficient with low total energy consumption and carbon emissions—a popular type is the passive house the global design and construction industry is responsible for approximately 39 percent of greenhouse gas emissions green building practices that avoid emissions or capture the carbon already present in the environment, allow for reduced footprint of the construction industry, for example, use of hempcrete, cellulose fiber insulation, and landscaping in 2019, the building sector was responsible for 12 gtco2-eq emissions more than 95% of these emissions were carbon, and the remaining 5% were ch4 n20 and halocarbon the digital sector produces between 2% and 4% of global ghg emissions, a large part of which is from chipmaking however the sector reduces emissions from other sectors which have a larger global share, such as transport of people, and possibly buildings and industry the healthcare sector produces 4 4% - 4 6% of global greenhouse gas emissions steel and aluminum are key economic sectors for the carbon capture and storage according to a 2013 study, \"in 2004, the steel industry along emits about 590m tons of co2, which accounts for 5 2% of the global anthropogenic ghg emissions co2 emitted from steel production primarily comes from energy consumption of fossil fuel as well as the use of limestone to purify iron oxides \"coal-fired power stations are the single largest emitter, with over 20% of global ghg in 2018 although much less polluting than coal plants, natural gas-fired power plants are also major emitters, taking electricity generation as a whole over 25% in 2018 notably, just 5% of the world\\'s power plants account for almost three-quarters of carbon emissions from electricity generation, based on an inventory of more than 29,000 fossil-fuel power plants across 221 countries in the 2022 ipcc report, it is noted that providing modern energy services universally would only increase greenhouse gas emissions by a few percent at most this slight increase means that the additional energy demand that comes from supporting decent living standards for all would be far lower than current average energy consumption plastics are produced mainly from fossil fuels it was estimated that between 3% and 4% of global ghg emissions are associated with plastics\\' life cycles the epa estimates as many as five mass units of carbon dioxide are emitted for each mass unit of polyethylene terephthalate (pet) produced—the type of plastic most commonly used for beverage bottles, the transportation produce greenhouse gases also plastic waste emits carbon dioxide when it degrades in 2018 research claimed that some of the most common plastics in the environment release the greenhouse gases methane and ethylene when exposed to sunlight in an amount that can affect the earth climate due to the lightness of plastic versus glass or metal, plastic may reduce energy consumption for example, packaging beverages in pet plastic rather than glass or metal is estimated to save 52% in transportation energy, if the glass or metal package is single-use, of course in 2019 a new report \"plastic and climate\" was published according to the report, the production and incineration of plastics will contribute in the equivalent of 850\\xa0million tonnes of carbon dioxide (co2) to the atmosphere in 2019 with the current trend, annual life cycle greenhouse gas emissions of plastics will grow to 1 34\\xa0billion tonnes by 2030 by 2050, the life cycle emissions of plastics could reach 56\\xa0billion tonnes, as much as 14 percent of the earth\\'s remaining carbon budget the report says that only solutions which involve a reduction in consumption can solve the problem, while others like biodegradable plastic, ocean cleanup, using renewable energy in plastic industry can do little, and in some cases may even worsen it wastewater as well as sanitation systems are known to contribute to greenhouse-gas emissions (ghg)[quantify] mainly through the breakdown of excreta during the treatment process this results in the generation of methane gas, that is then released into the environment emissions from the sanitation and wastewater sector have been focused mainly on treatment systems, particularly treatment plants, and this accounts for the bulk of the carbon footprint for the sector in as much as climate impacts from wastewater and sanitation systems present global risks, low-income countries experience greater risks in many cases in recent years,[when?] attention to adaptation needs within the sanitation sector is just beginning to gain momentum according to unep, global tourism is a significant contributor to the increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere over a quarter of global transport co2 emissions are from road freight, so many countries are further restricting truck co2 emissions to help limit climate change deforestation is a major source of greenhouse gas emissions a study shows annual carbon emissions (or carbon loss) from tropical deforestation have doubled during the last two decades and continue to increase (0 97\\u2009±0 16\\u2009pgc\\u2009per year in 2001–2005 to 1 99\\u2009±0 13\\u2009pgc\\u2009per year in 2015–2019)land-use change, e g , the clearing of forests for agricultural use, can affect the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere by altering how much carbon flows out of the atmosphere into carbon sinks accounting for land-use change can be understood as an attempt to measure \"net\" emissions, i e , gross emissions from all sources minus the removal of emissions from the atmosphere by carbon sinks :\\u200a92–93\\u200athere are substantial uncertainties in the measurement of net carbon emissions additionally, there is controversy over how carbon sinks should be allocated between different regions and over time :\\u200a93\\u200a for instance, concentrating on more recent changes in carbon sinks is likely to favour those regions that have deforested earlier, e g , europe greenhouse gas intensity is a ratio between greenhouse gas emissions and another metric, e g , gross domestic product (gdp) or energy use the terms \"carbon intensity\" and \"emissions intensity\" are also sometimes used emission intensities may be calculated using market exchange rates (mer) or purchasing power parity (ppp) :\\u200a96\\u200a calculations based on mer show large differences in intensities between developed and developing countries, whereas calculations based on ppp show smaller differences according to a study discussing the relationship between urbanization and carbon emissions, urbanization is becoming a huge player in the global carbon cycle depending on total carbon emissions done by a city that hasn\\'t invested in carbon efficiency or improved resource management, the global carbon cycle is projected to reach 75% of the world population by 2030 cumulative anthropogenic (i e , human-emitted) emissions of co2 from fossil fuel use are a major cause of global warming, and give some indication of which countries have contributed most to human-induced climate change in particular, co2 stays in the atmosphere for at least 150 years, whilst methane and nitrous oxides generally disappear within a decade or so the graph gives some indication of which regions have contributed most to human-induced climate change :\\u200a15\\u200a when these numbers are calculated per capita cumulative emissions based on then-current population the situation is shown even more clearly the ratio in per capita emissions between industrialized countries and developing countries was estimated at more than 10 to 1 non-oecd countries accounted for 42% of cumulative energy-related co2 emissions between 1890 and 2007 :\\u200a179–80\\u200a over this time period, the us accounted for 28% of emissions; the eu, 23%; japan, 4%; other oecd countries 5%; russia, 11%; china, 9%; india, 3%; and the rest of the world, 18% :\\u200a179–80\\u200aoverall, developed countries accounted for 83 8% of industrial co2 emissions over this time period, and 67 8% of total co2 emissions developing countries accounted for industrial co2 emissions of 16 2% over this time period, and 32 2% of total co2 emissions in comparison, humans have emitted more greenhouse gases than the chicxulub meteorite impact event which caused the extinction of the dinosaurs transport, together with electricity generation, is the major source of greenhouse gas emissions in the eu greenhouse gas emissions from the transportation sector continue to rise, in contrast to power generation and nearly all other sectors since 1990, transportation emissions have increased by 30% the transportation sector accounts for around 70% of these emissions the majority of these emissions are caused by passenger vehicles and vans road travel is the first major source of greenhouse gas emissions from transportation, followed by aircraft and maritime waterborne transportation is still the least carbon-intensive mode of transportation on average, and it is an essential link in sustainable multimodal freight supply chains buildings, like industry, are directly responsible for around one-fifth of greenhouse gas emissions, primarily from space heating and hot water consumption when combined with power consumption within buildings, this figure climbs to more than one-third within the eu, the agricultural sector presently accounts for roughly 10% of total greenhouse gas emissions, with methane from livestock accounting for slightly more than half of 10% estimates of total co2 emissions do include biotic carbon emissions, mainly from deforestation :\\u200a94\\u200a including biotic emissions brings about the same controversy mentioned earlier regarding carbon sinks and land-use change :\\u200a93–94\\u200a the actual calculation of net emissions is very complex, and is affected by how carbon sinks are allocated between regions and the dynamics of the climate system the graphic shows the logarithm of 1850-2019 fossil fuel co2 emissions; natural log on left, actual value of gigatons per year on right although emissions increased during the 170-year period by about 3% per year overall, intervals of distinctly different growth rates (broken at 1913, 1945, and 1973) can be detected the regression lines suggest that emissions can  rapidly shift from one growth regime to another and then persist for long periods of time the most recent drop in emissions growth - by almost 3 percentage points - was at about the time of the 1970s energy crisis percent changes per year were estimated by piecewise linear regression on the log data and are shown on the plot; the data are from the integrated carbon observation system the sharp acceleration in co2 emissions since 2000 to more than a 3% increase per year (more than 2\\xa0ppm per year) from 1 1% per year during the 1990s is attributable to the lapse of formerly declining trends in carbon intensity of both developing and developed nations china was responsible for most of global growth in emissions during this period localised plummeting emissions associated with the collapse of the soviet union have been followed by slow emissions growth in this region due to more efficient energy use, made necessary by the increasing proportion of it that is exported in comparison, methane has not increased appreciably, and n2o by 0 25% y−1 using different base years for measuring emissions has an effect on estimates of national contributions to global warming :\\u200a17–18\\u200a this can be calculated by dividing a country\\'s highest contribution to global warming starting from a particular base year, by that country\\'s minimum contribution to global warming starting from a particular base year choosing between base years of 1750, 1900, 1950, and 1990 has a significant effect for most countries :\\u200a17–18\\u200a within the g8 group of countries, it is most significant for the uk, france and germany these countries have a long history of co2 emissions (see the section on cumulative and historical emissions) annual per capita emissions in the industrialized countries are typically as much as ten times the average in developing countries :\\u200a144\\u200a due to china\\'s fast economic development, its annual per capita emissions are quickly approaching the levels of those in the annex i group of the kyoto protocol (i e , the developed countries excluding the us) other countries with fast growing emissions are south korea, iran, and australia (which apart from the oil rich persian gulf states, now has the highest per capita emission rate in the world) on the other hand, annual per capita emissions of the eu-15 and the us are gradually decreasing over time emissions in russia and ukraine have decreased fastest since 1990 due to economic restructuring in these countries energy statistics for fast-growing economies are less accurate than those for industrialized countries the greenhouse gas footprint refers to the emissions resulting from the creation of products or services it is more comprehensive than the commonly used carbon footprint, which measures only carbon dioxide, one of many greenhouse gases [citation needed]2015 was the first year to see both total global economic growth and a reduction of carbon emissions in 2019, china, the united states, india, the eu27+uk, russia, and japan - the world\\'s largest co2 emitters - together accounted for 51% of the population, 62 5% of global gross domestic product, 62% of total global fossil fuel consumption and emitted 67% of total global fossil co2 emissions from these five countries and the eu28 show different changes in 2019 compared to 2018: the largest relative increase is found for china (+3 4%), followed by india (+1 6%) on the contrary, the eu27+uk (-3 8%), the united states (-2 6%), japan (-2 1%) and russia (-0 8%) reduced their fossil co2 emissions one way of attributing greenhouse gas emissions is to measure the embedded emissions (also referred to as \"embodied emissions\") of goods that are being consumed emissions are usually measured according to production, rather than consumption for example, in the main international treaty on climate change (the unfccc), countries report on emissions produced within their borders, e g , the emissions produced from burning fossil fuels :\\u200a179\\u200a:\\u200a1\\u200a under a production-based accounting of emissions, embedded emissions on imported goods are attributed to the exporting, rather than the importing, country under a consumption-based accounting of emissions, embedded emissions on imported goods are attributed to the importing country, rather than the exporting, country davis and caldeira (2010):\\u200a4\\u200a found that a substantial proportion of co2 emissions are traded internationally the net effect of trade was to export emissions from china and other emerging markets to consumers in the us, japan, and western europe as carbon oxides are one important source of greenhouse gas, having means to reduce it is important one suggestion, is to consider some means in relation to fiscal decentralisation previous research found that the linear term of fiscal decentralization promotes carbon emissions, while the non-linear term mitigates it [clarification needed] it verified the inverted u-shaped curve between fiscal decentralization and carbon emissions [example  needed] besides, increasing energy prices for non-renewable energy decrease carbon emission due to a substitution effect among other explanatory variables, improvement in the quality of institutions decreases carbon emissions, while the gross domestic product increases it strengthening fiscal decentralization, lowering non-renewable energy prices,[clarification needed] and improving institutional quality to check the deteriorating environmental quality in the study sample and other worldwide regions can reduce carbon emissions governments have taken action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to mitigate climate change assessments of policy effectiveness have included work by the intergovernmental panel on climate change, international energy agency, and united nations environment programme policies implemented by governments have included national and regional targets to reduce emissions, promoting energy efficiency, and support for a renewable energy transition, such as solar energy, as an effective use of renewable energy because solar uses energy from the sun and does not release pollutants into the air countries and regions listed in annex i of the united nations framework convention on climate change (unfccc) (i e , the oecd and former planned economies of the soviet union) are required to submit periodic assessments to the unfccc of actions they are taking to address climate change :\\u200a3\\u200adue to the covid-19 pandemic, there was a significant reduction in co2 emissions globally in 2020 in 2020, carbon dioxide (co2) reductions were at an all-time low since world war ii however, by december 2020, carbon emissions surpassed those in 2019 by 2% climate change scenarios or socioeconomic scenarios are projections of future greenhouse gas (ghg) emissions used by analysts to assess future vulnerability to climate change scenarios and pathways are created by scientists to survey any long term routes and explore the effectiveness of mitigation and helps us understand what the future may hold this will allow us to envision the future of human environment system producing scenarios requires estimates of future population levels, economic activity, the structure of governance, social values, and patterns of technological change economic and energy modelling (such as the world3 or the poles models) can be used to analyze and quantify the effects of such drivers scientists can develop separate international, regional and national climate change scenarios these scenarios are designed to help stakeholders understand what kinds of decisions will have meaningful effects on climate change mitigation or adaptation most countries developing adaptation plans or nationally determined contributions will commission scenario studies in order to better understand the decisions available to them polar amplification is the phenomenon that any change in the net radiation balance (for example greenhouse intensification) tends to produce a larger change in temperature near the poles than in the planetary average this is commonly referred to as the ratio of polar warming to tropical warming on a planet with an atmosphere that can restrict emission of longwave radiation to space (a greenhouse effect), surface temperatures will be warmer than a simple planetary equilibrium temperature calculation would predict where the atmosphere or an extensive ocean is able to transport heat polewards, the poles will be warmer and equatorial regions cooler than their local net radiation balances would predict the poles will experience the most cooling when the global-mean temperature is lower relative to a reference climate; alternatively, the poles will experience the greatest warming when the global-mean temperature is higher in the extreme, the planet venus is thought to have experienced a very large increase in greenhouse effect over its lifetime, so much so that its poles have warmed sufficiently to render its surface temperature effectively isothermal (no difference between poles and equator) on earth, water vapor and trace gasses provide a lesser greenhouse effect, and the atmosphere and extensive oceans provide efficient poleward heat transport both palaeoclimate changes and recent global warming changes have exhibited strong polar amplification, as described below arctic amplification is polar amplification of the earth\\'s north pole only; antarctic amplification is that of the south pole an observation-based study related to arctic amplification was published in 1969 by mikhail budyko, and the study conclusion has been summarized as \"sea ice loss affects arctic temperatures through the surface albedo feedback \" the same year, a similar model was published by william d sellers both studies attracted significant attention since they hinted at the possibility for a runaway positive feedback within the global climate system in 1975, manabe and wetherald published the first somewhat plausible general circulation model that looked at the effects of an increase of greenhouse gas although confined to less than one-third of the globe, with a \"swamp\" ocean and only land surface at high latitudes, it showed an arctic warming faster than the tropics (as have all subsequent models) feedbacks associated with sea ice and snow cover are widely cited as one of the principal causes of recent terrestrial polar amplification these feedbacks are particularly noted in local polar amplification, although recent work has shown that the lapse rate feedback is likely equally important to the ice-albedo feedback for arctic amplification supporting this idea, large-scale amplification is also observed in model worlds with no ice or snow it appears to arise both from a (possibly transient) intensification of poleward heat transport and more directly from changes in the local net radiation balance local radiation balance is crucial because an overall decrease in outgoing longwave radiation will produce a larger relative increase in net radiation near the poles than near the equator thus, between the lapse rate feedback and changes in the local radiation balance, much of polar amplification can be attributed to changes in outgoing longwave radiation this is especially true for the arctic, whereas the elevated terrain in antarctica limits the influence of the lapse rate feedback some examples of climate system feedbacks thought to contribute to recent polar amplification include the reduction of snow cover and sea ice, changes in atmospheric and ocean circulation, the presence of anthropogenic soot in the arctic environment, and increases in cloud cover and water vapor co2 forcing has also been attributed to polar amplification most studies connect sea ice changes to polar amplification both ice extent and thickness impact polar amplification climate models with smaller baseline sea ice extent and thinner sea ice coverage exhibit stronger polar amplification some models of modern climate exhibit arctic amplification without changes in snow and ice cover the individual processes contributing to polar warming are critical to understanding climate sensitivity polar warming also affects many ecosystems, including marine and terrestrial ecosystems, climate systems, and human populations these impacts of polar amplification have led to continuous research in the face of global warming it has been estimated that 70% of global wind energy is transferred to the ocean and takes place within the antarctic circumpolar current (acc) eventually, upwelling due to wind-stress transports cold antarctic waters through the atlantic surface current, while warming them over the equator, and into the arctic environment this is especially noticed in high latitudes thus, warming in the arctic depends on the efficiency of the global ocean transport and plays a role in the polar see-saw effect decreased oxygen and low-ph during la niña are processes that correlate with decreased primary production and a more pronounced poleward flow of ocean currents it has been proposed that the mechanism of increased arctic surface air temperature anomalies during la niña periods of enso may be attributed to the tropically excited arctic warming mechanism (team), when rossby waves propagate more poleward, leading to wave dynamics and an increase in downward infrared radiation polar amplification is quantified in terms of a polar amplification factor, generally defined as the ratio of some change in a polar temperature to a corresponding change in a broader average temperature:where δtp{\\\\displaystyle \\\\delta {t}_{p}} is a change in polar temperature and δt¯{\\\\displaystyle \\\\delta {\\\\overline {t}}}\\xa0\\xa0 is, for example, a corresponding change in a global mean temperature common implementations define the temperature changes directly as the anomalies in surface air temperature relative to a recent reference interval (typically 30 years) others have used the ratio of the variances of surface air temperature over an extended interval it is observed that arctic and antarctic warming commonly proceed out of phase because of orbital forcing, resulting in the so-called polar see-saw effect the glacial / interglacial cycles of the pleistocene provide extensive palaeoclimate evidence of polar amplification, both from the arctic and the antarctic in particular, the temperature rise since the last glacial maximum 20,000 years ago provides a clear picture proxy temperature records from the arctic (greenland) and from the antarctic indicate polar amplification factors on the order of 2 0 suggested mechanisms leading to the observed arctic amplification include arctic sea ice decline (open water reflects less sunlight than sea ice), atmospheric heat transport from the equator to the arctic, and the lapse rate feedback jennifer francis told scientific american in 2017, \"a lot more water vapor is being transported northward by big swings in the jet stream that\\'s important because water vapor is a greenhouse gas just like carbon dioxide and methane it traps heat in the atmosphere that vapor also condenses as droplets we know as clouds, which themselves trap more heat the vapor is a big part of the amplification story—a big reason the arctic is warming faster than anywhere else \"some studies have linked rapidly warming arctic temperatures, and thus a vanishing cryosphere, to extreme weather in mid-latitudes other studies do not support a connection between sea-ice loss and mid-latitude extremes in particular, one hypothesis links polar amplification to extreme weather by changing the polar jet stream however, a 2013 study noted that extreme events in particular associated with sea ice and snow cover decline have not yet been observed for long enough to distinguish natural climate variability from impacts related to recent climate change there remains controversy over the relationship between polar amplification in regards to sea-ice loss and latitudinal extremes studies published in 2017 and 2018 identified stalling patterns of rossby waves, in the northern hemisphere jet stream, to have caused almost stationary extreme weather events, such as the 2018 european heatwave, the 2003 european heat wave, 2010 russian heat wave, 2010 pakistan floods—these events have been linked to global warming, the rapid heating of the arctic according to a 2009 study the atlantic multi-decadal oscillation (amo) is highly correlated with changes in arctic temperature, suggesting that the atlantic ocean thermohaline circulation is linked to temperature variability in the arctic on a multi-decadal time scale a study in 2014 concluded that arctic amplification significantly decreased cold-season temperature variability over the northern hemisphere in recent decades cold arctic air intrudes into the warmer lower latitudes more rapidly today during autumn and winter, a trend projected to continue in the future except during summer, thus calling into question whether winters will bring more cold extremes according to a 2015 study, based on computer modelling of aerosols in the atmosphere, up to 0 5 degrees celsius of the warming observed in the arctic between 1980 and 2005 is due to aerosol reductions in europe categoriesocean acidification is the ongoing decrease in the ph value of the earth\\'s oceans, caused by the uptake of carbon dioxide (co2) from the atmosphere the main cause of ocean acidification is human burning of fossil fuels as the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere increases, the amount of carbon dioxide absorbed by the ocean also increases this leads to a series of chemical reactions in the seawater which has a negative spillover on the ocean and species living below water when carbon dioxide dissolves into seawater, it forms carbonic acid (h2co3) some of the carbonic acid molecules dissociate into a bicarbonate ion and a hydrogen ion, thus increasing ocean acidity (h+ ion concentration) between 1751 and 1996, the ph value of the ocean surface is estimated to have decreased from approximately 8 25 to 8 14, representing an increase of almost 30% in h+ ion concentration in the world\\'s oceans (the ph scale is logarithmic, so a change of one in ph unit is equivalent to a tenfold change in h+ ion concentration) the ocean\\'s ph value as of 2020 was 8 1, meaning it is currently lightly basic (the ph being higher than 7) ocean acidification will result in a shift towards a lower ph value, meaning the water will become less basic and therefore more acidic ocean acidification can lead to decreased production of the shells of shellfish and other aquatic life with calcium carbonate shells, as well as some other physiological challenges for marine organisms the calcium carbonate-shelled organisms can not reproduce under high saturated acidotic waters there is a variation in sea-surface ph globally with colder and higher latitude oceans having the ability to dissolve more co2 as well as lower bicarbonate saturation levels, further decreasing the ability of marine organisms to produce hard shells factors such as ocean currents, large continental rivers diluting seawater salinity, ice melt, and the deposition of nitrogen and sulfur from fossil fuel burning and agriculture also influence ocean acidity ocean acidification has occurred previously in earth\\'s history, and the resulting ecological collapse in the oceans had long-lasting effects on global carbon cycling and climate increasing acidity is thought to have a range of potentially harmful consequences for marine organisms such as depressing metabolic rates and immune responses in some organisms and causing coral bleaching ocean acidification is impacting on the ecosystems of marine environments that provide food, livelihoods, and other ecosystem services for a large proportion of the human population some 1 billion people are wholly or partially dependent on the ecosystem services provided by coral reefs in terms of fishing, tourism, and coastal management by increasing the presence of free hydrogen ions, the additional carbonic acid that forms in the oceans ultimately results in the conversion of carbonate ions into bicarbonate ions ocean alkalinity is not changed by the process, or may increase over long time periods due to carbonate dissolution this net decrease in the number of carbonate ions available may make it more difficult for marine calcifying organisms, such as coral and some plankton, to form biogenic calcium carbonate, and such structures become vulnerable to dissolution ongoing acidification of the oceans may therefore threaten future food chains linked with the oceans ocean acidification is one of several effects of climate change on oceans the main solution to ocean acidification lies in reducing atmospheric co2 levels as members of the interacademy panel, 105 science academies have issued a statement on ocean acidification recommending that by 2050, global co2 emissions be reduced by at least 50% compared to the 1990 level the united nation\\'s sustainable development goal 14 (\"life below water\") has a target to \"minimize and address the impacts of ocean acidification\" human activities such as the combustion of fossil fuels and land-use changes have led to a new flux of co2 into the atmosphere about 45% has remained in the atmosphere; most of the rest has been taken up by the oceans, with some taken up by terrestrial plants the carbon cycle describes the fluxes of carbon dioxide (co2) between the oceans, terrestrial biosphere, lithosphere, and atmosphere the carbon cycle involves both organic compounds such as cellulose and inorganic carbon compounds such as carbon dioxide, carbonate ion, and bicarbonate ion the inorganic compounds are particularly relevant when discussing ocean acidification for they include many forms of dissolved co2 present in the earth\\'s oceans when co2 dissolves, it reacts with water to form a balance of ionic and non-ionic chemical species: dissolved free carbon dioxide (co2(aq)), carbonic acid (h2co3), bicarbonate (hco−3) and carbonate (co2−3) the ratio of these species depends on factors such as seawater temperature, pressure and salinity (as shown in a bjerrum plot) these different forms of dissolved inorganic carbon are transferred from an ocean\\'s surface to its interior by the ocean\\'s solubility pump the resistance of an area of ocean to absorbing atmospheric co2 is known as the revelle factor ocean acidification has been compared to anthropogenic climate change and called the \"evil twin of global warming\" and \"the other co2 problem\" increased ocean temperatures and oxygen loss act concurrently with ocean acidification and constitute the \"deadly trio\" of climate change pressures on the marine environment freshwater bodies also appear to be acidifying, although this is a more complex and less obvious phenomenon an estimated 30–40% of the carbon dioxide from human activity released into the atmosphere dissolves into oceans, rivers and lakes dissolving co2 in seawater increases the hydrogen ion (h+) concentration in the ocean, and thus decreases ocean ph, as follows:approximately one-third of the carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere by human activity is dissolved into oceans, rivers, and lakes, resulting in increasing levels of acidification ocean surface acidity levels have increased by 30% since the beginning of the industrial revolution since the industrial revolution began, the ocean has absorbed about a third of the co2 we have produced since then and it is estimated that surface ocean ph has dropped by slightly more than 0 1 units on the logarithmic scale of ph, representing about a 29% increase in h+ it is expected to drop by a further 0 3 to 0 5 ph units (an additional doubling to tripling of today\\'s post-industrial acid concentrations) by 2100 as the oceans absorb more anthropogenic co2, the impacts being most severe for coral reefs and the southern ocean these changes are predicted to accelerate as more anthropogenic co2 is released into the atmosphere and taken up by the oceans the degree of change to ocean chemistry, including ocean ph, will depend on the mitigation and emissions pathways taken by society although the largest changes are expected in the future, a report from noaa scientists found large quantities of water undersaturated in aragonite are already upwelling close to the pacific continental shelf area of north america continental shelves play an important role in marine ecosystems since most marine organisms live or are spawned there, and though the study only dealt with the area from vancouver to northern california, the authors suggest that other shelf areas may be experiencing similar effects in shallow coastal and shelf regions, a number of factors interplay to affect ph change in addition to atmospheric co2 these include biological processes, such as photosynthesis and respiration, and water upwelling onto the coast can be modified by these processes also, ecosystem metabolism in freshwater sources reaching coastal waters can lead to large ph changes there, with the rates of biologically induced ph change dependent on local water temperature if we continue emitting co2 at the same rate, by 2100 ocean acidity will increase by about 150 percent, a rate that has not been experienced for at least 400,000 years one of the first detailed datasets to examine how ph varied over 8 years at a specific north temperate coastal location found that acidification had strong links to in situ benthic species dynamics and that the variation in ocean ph may cause calcareous species to perform more poorly than noncalcareous species in years with low ph and predicts consequences for near-shore benthic ecosystems current rates of ocean acidification have been compared with the greenhouse event at the paleocene–eocene boundary (about 55\\xa0million years ago) when surface ocean temperatures rose by 5–6\\xa0degrees celsius no catastrophe was seen in surface ecosystems, yet bottom-dwelling organisms in the deep ocean experienced a major extinction the current acidification is on a path to reach levels higher than any seen in the last 65\\xa0million years, and the rate of increase is about ten times the rate that preceded the paleocene–eocene mass extinction the current and projected acidification has been described as an almost unprecedented geological event a national research council study released in april 2010 likewise concluded that \"the level of acid in the oceans is increasing at an unprecedented rate\" a 2012 paper in the journal science examined the geological record in an attempt to find a historical analog for current global conditions as well as those of the future the researchers determined that the current rate of ocean acidification is faster than at any time in the past 300\\xa0million years a review by climate scientists at the realclimate blog, of a 2005 report by the royal society of the uk similarly highlighted the centrality of the rates of change in the present anthropogenic acidification process, writing:the natural ph of the ocean is determined by a need to balance the deposition and burial of caco3 on the sea floor against the influx of ca2+ and co2−3 into the ocean from dissolving rocks on land, called weathering these processes stabilize the ph of the ocean, by a mechanism called caco3 compensation\\xa0   the point of bringing it up again is to note that if the co2 concentration of the atmosphere changes more slowly than this, as it always has throughout the vostok record, the ph of the ocean will be relatively unaffected because caco3 compensation can keep up the [present] fossil fuel acidification is much faster than natural changes, and so the acid spike will be more intense than the earth has seen in at least 800,000\\xa0years in the 15-year period 1995–2010 alone, acidity has increased 6 percent in the upper 100\\xa0meters of the pacific ocean from hawaii to alaska according to a statement in july 2012 by jane lubchenco, head of the u s national oceanic and atmospheric administration \"surface waters are changing much more rapidly than initial calculations have suggested it\\'s yet another reason to be very seriously concerned about the amount of carbon dioxide that is in the atmosphere now and the additional amount we continue to put out \"a 2013 study claimed acidity was increasing at a rate 10 times faster than in any of the evolutionary crises in earth\\'s history in a synthesis report published in science in 2015, 22 leading marine scientists stated that co2 from burning fossil fuels is changing the oceans\\' chemistry more rapidly than at any time since the great dying, earth\\'s most severe known extinction event, emphasizing that the 2\\xa0°c maximum temperature increase agreed upon by governments reflects too small a cut in emissions to prevent \"dramatic impacts\" on the world\\'s oceans, with lead author jean-pierre gattuso remarking that \"the ocean has been minimally considered at previous climate negotiations our study provides compelling arguments for a radical change at the un conference (in paris) on climate change\" the rate at which ocean acidification will occur may be influenced by the rate of surface ocean warming, because the chemical equilibria that govern seawater ph are temperature-dependent greater seawater warming could lead to a smaller change in ph for a given increase in co2 the difference in changes in temperature and salinity between basins is one of the main reasons for the difreances in acidification rates in different localaties earth system models project that, by around 2008, ocean acidity exceeded historical analogues and, in combination with other ocean biogeochemical changes, could undermine the functioning of marine ecosystems and disrupt the provision of many goods and services associated with the ocean beginning as early as 2100 if the \\'business as usual\\' model for human activity persists, it is estimated that ocean ph in the year 2100 could be decreased by 0 2 to 0 5 units compared to the present day the oceans have not experienced this level of acidity for 14 million years an ecological tipping point was projected to occur by 2030 and no later than 2038 thomas lovejoy, former chief biodiversity advisor to the world bank, has suggested that \"the acidity of the oceans will more than double in the next 40\\xa0years he says this rate is 100 times faster than any changes in ocean acidity in the last 20\\xa0million years, making it unlikely that marine life can somehow adapt to the changes \" it is predicted that, by the year 2100, if co-occurring biogeochemical changes influence the delivery of ocean goods and services, then they could also have a considerable effect on human welfare for those who rely heavily on the ocean for food, jobs, and revenues a panel of experts who had previously participated in the ipcc reports have determined that it is not yet possible to determine a threshold for ocean acidity that should not be exceeded changes in ocean chemistry can have extensive direct and indirect effects on organisms and their habitats one of the most important repercussions of increasing ocean acidity relates to the production of shells and plates out of calcium carbonate (caco3) this process is called calcification and is important to the biology and survival of a wide range of marine organisms calcification involves the precipitation of dissolved ions into solid caco3 structures, such as coccoliths after they are formed, such structures are vulnerable to dissolution unless the surrounding seawater contains saturating concentrations of carbonate ions (co32−) of the extra carbon dioxide added into the oceans, some remains as dissolved carbon dioxide, while the rest contributes towards making additional bicarbonate (and additional carbonic acid) this also increases the concentration of hydrogen ions, and the percentage increase in hydrogen is larger than the percentage increase in bicarbonate, creating an imbalance in the reaction hco3− ⇌ co32− + h+ to maintain chemical equilibrium, some of the carbonate ions already in the ocean combine with some of the hydrogen ions to make further bicarbonate thus the ocean\\'s concentration of carbonate ions is reduced, creating an imbalance in the reaction ca2+ + co32− ⇌ caco3, and making the dissolution of formed caco3 structures more likely the increase in concentrations of dissolved carbon dioxide and bicarbonate, and reduction in carbonate, are shown in a bjerrum plot the saturation state (known as ω) of seawater for a mineral is a measure of the thermodynamic potential for the mineral to form or to dissolve, and for calcium carbonate is described by the following equation:here ω is the product of the concentrations (or activities) of the reacting ions that form the mineral (ca2+ and co2−3), divided by the product of the concentrations of those ions when the mineral is at equilibrium (ksp), that is, when the mineral is neither forming nor dissolving in seawater, a natural horizontal boundary is formed as a result of temperature, pressure, and depth, and is known as the saturation horizon above this saturation horizon, ω has a value greater than 1, and caco3 does not readily dissolve most calcifying organisms live in such waters below this depth, ω has a value less than 1, and caco3 will dissolve however, if its production rate is high enough to offset dissolution, caco3 can still occur where ω is less than 1 the carbonate compensation depth occurs at the depth in the ocean where production is exceeded by dissolution the decrease in the concentration of co32− decreases ω, and hence makes caco3 dissolution more likely calcium carbonate occurs in two common polymorphs (crystalline forms): aragonite and calcite aragonite is much more soluble than calcite, so the aragonite saturation horizon is always nearer to the surface than the calcite saturation horizon this also means that those organisms that produce aragonite may be more vulnerable to changes in ocean acidity than those that produce calcite increasing co2 levels and the resulting lower ph of seawater decreases the saturation state of caco3 and raises the saturation horizons of both forms closer to the surface this decrease in saturation state is believed to be one of the main factors leading to decreased calcification in marine organisms, as the inorganic precipitation of caco3 is directly proportional to its saturation state increasing acidity has possibly harmful consequences, such as depressing metabolic rates in jumbo squid, depressing the immune responses of blue mussels, and coral bleaching the reports \"ocean acidification summary for policymakers 2013\" and the ipcc approved \"special report on the ocean and cryosphere in a changing climate\" from 2019 describe research findings and possible impacts the phenomenon of coral bleaching or coral whitening and the degeneration of coralline reef ecosystems is one consequence of increasing ocean acidity the tropical and sub-tropical environments, including areas such as the caribbean and surrounding regions, tropical asia (e g indonesia, philippines, thailand, maldives) and the tropical pacific (e g australian barrier reef, pacific islands, papua new guinea) are mostly affected by coral bleaching, as these are the regions of the world that contain the largest and most extensive coral reef systems increasing ocean acidification makes it more difficult for shell-accreting organisms to access carbonate ions, essential for the production of their hard exoskeletal shell oceanic calcifying organism span the food chain from autotrophs to heterotrophs and include organisms such as coccolithophores, corals, foraminifera, echinoderms, crustaceans and molluscs as described above, under normal conditions, calcite and aragonite are stable in surface waters since the carbonate ion is at supersaturating concentrations however, as ocean ph falls, the concentration of carbonate ions also decreases, and when carbonate becomes undersaturated, structures made of calcium carbonate are vulnerable to dissolution therefore, even if there is no change in the rate of calcification, the rate of dissolution of calcareous material increases corals, coccolithophore algae, coralline algae, foraminifera, shellfish and pteropods experience reduced calcification or enhanced dissolution when exposed to elevated co2 the royal society published a comprehensive overview of ocean acidification, and its potential consequences, in june 2005 however, some studies have found different responses to ocean acidification, with coccolithophore calcification and photosynthesis both increasing under elevated atmospheric pco2, an equal decline in primary production and calcification in response to elevated co2 or the direction of the response varying between species a study in 2008 examining a sediment core from the north atlantic found that while the species composition of coccolithophorids has remained unchanged for the industrial period 1780 to 2004, the calcification of coccoliths has increased by up to 40% during the same time a 2010 study from stony brook university suggested that while some areas are overharvested and other fishing grounds are being restored, because of ocean acidification it may be impossible to bring back many previous shellfish populations while the full ecological consequences of these changes in calcification are still uncertain, it appears likely that many calcifying species will be adversely affected when exposed in experiments to ph reduced by 0 2 to 0 4, larvae of a temperate brittlestar, a relative of the common sea star, fewer than 0 1 percent survived more than eight days there is also a suggestion that a decline in the coccolithophores may have secondary effects on climate, contributing to global warming by decreasing the earth\\'s albedo via their effects on oceanic cloud cover all marine ecosystems on earth will be exposed to changes in acidification and several other ocean biogeochemical changes the fluid in the internal compartments (the coelenteron) where corals grow their exoskeleton is also extremely important for calcification growth when the saturation rate of aragonite in the external seawater is at ambient levels, the corals will grow their aragonite crystals rapidly in their internal compartments, hence their exoskeleton grows rapidly if the level of aragonite in the external seawater is lower than the ambient level, the corals have to work harder to maintain the right balance in the internal compartment when that happens, the process of growing the crystals slows down, and this slows down the rate of how much their exoskeleton is growing depending on how much aragonite is in the surrounding water, the corals may even stop growing because the levels of aragonite are too low to pump into the internal compartment they could even dissolve faster than they can make the crystals to their skeleton, depending on the aragonite levels in the surrounding water under the current progression of carbon emissions, around 70% of north atlantic cold-water corals will be living in corrosive waters by 2050–60 a study conducted by the woods hole oceanographic institution in january 2018 showed that the skeletal growth of corals under acidified conditions is primarily affected by a reduced capacity to build dense exoskeletons, rather than affecting the linear extension of the exoskeleton using global climate models, they show that the density of some species of corals could be reduced by over 20% by the end of this century an in situ experiment on a 400\\xa0m2 patch of the great barrier reef to decrease seawater co2 level (raise ph) to close to the preindustrial value showed a 7% increase in net calcification a similar experiment to raise in situ seawater co2 level (lower ph) to a level expected soon after the middle of this century found that net calcification decreased 34% ocean acidification may force some organisms to reallocate resources away from productive endpoints such as growth in order to maintain calcification for example, the oyster magallana gigas is recognized to experience metabolic changes alongside altered calcification rates due to energetic tradeoffs resulting from ph imbalances in some places carbon dioxide bubbles out from the sea floor, locally changing the ph and other aspects of the chemistry of the seawater studies of these carbon dioxide seeps have documented a variety of responses by different organisms coral reef communities located near carbon dioxide seeps are of particular interest because of the sensitivity of some corals species to acidification in papua new guinea, declining ph caused by carbon dioxide seeps is associated with declines in coral species diversity however, in palau carbon dioxide seeps are not associated with reduced species diversity of corals, although bioerosion of coral skeletons is much higher at low ph sites ocean acidification may affect the ocean\\'s biologically driven sequestration of carbon from the atmosphere to the ocean interior and seafloor sediment, weakening the so-called biological pump seawater acidification could also see antarctic phytoplanktons smaller and less effective at storing carbon such changes are being increasingly studied and synthesized through the use of physiological frameworks, including the adverse outcome pathway (aop) framework aside from the slowing and/or reversal of calcification, organisms may suffer other adverse effects, either indirectly through negative impacts on food resources, or directly as reproductive or physiological effects for example, the elevated oceanic levels of co2 may produce co2-induced acidification of body fluids, known as hypercapnia also, increasing ocean acidity is believed to have a range of direct consequences for example, increasing acidity has been observed to: reduce metabolic rates in jumbo squid; depress the immune responses of blue mussels this is possibly because ocean acidification may alter the acoustic properties of seawater, allowing sound to propagate further, and increasing ocean noise this impacts all animals that use sound for echolocation or communication atlantic longfin squid eggs took longer to hatch in acidified water, and the squid\\'s statolith was smaller and malformed in animals placed in sea water with a lower ph the lower ph was simulated with 20–30 times the normal amount of co2 however, as with calcification, as yet there is not a full understanding of these processes in marine organisms or ecosystems another possible effect would be an increase in red tide events, which could contribute to the accumulation of toxins (domoic acid, brevetoxin, saxitoxin) in small organisms such as anchovies and shellfish, in turn increasing occurrences of amnesic shellfish poisoning, neurotoxic shellfish poisoning and paralytic shellfish poisoning although red tide is harmful, other beneficial photosynthetic organisms may benefit from increased levels of carbon dioxide most importantly, seagrasses will benefit an experiment done in 2018 concluded that as seagrasses increased their photosynthetic activity, calcifying algae\\'s calcification rates rose this could be a potential mitigation technique in the face of increasing acidity ocean acidification may benefit some species, for example increasing the growth rate of the sea star pisaster ochraceus ocean acidification can also have affects on marine fish larvae it internally affects their olfactory systems, which is a crucial part of their development, especially in the beginning stage of their life orange clownfish larvae mostly live on oceanic reefs that are surrounded by vegetative islands with the use of their sense of smell, larvae are known to be able to detect the differences between reefs surrounded by vegetative islands and reefs not surrounded by vegetative islands clownfish larvae need to be able to distinguish between these two destinations to have the ability to locate an area that is satisfactory for their growth another use for marine fish olfactory systems is to help in determining the difference between their parents and other adult fish in order to avoid inbreeding at james cook university\\'s experimental aquarium facility, clownfish were sustained in non-manipulated seawater that obtained a ph of 8 15\\xa0± 0 07 which is similar to our current ocean\\'s ph to test for effects of different ph levels, seawater was manipulated to three different ph levels, including the non-manipulated ph the two opposing ph levels correspond with climate change models that predict future atmospheric co2 levels in the year 2100 the model predicts that we could potentially acquire co2 levels at 1,000\\xa0ppm, which correlates with the ph of 7 8\\xa0± 0 05 results of this experiment show that when larvae is exposed to a ph of 7 8\\xa0± 0 05 their reaction to environmental cues differs drastically to larvae\\'s reaction to cues in a non-manipulated ph at the ph of 7 6\\xa0± 0 05 larvae had no reaction to any type of cue these results display the negative outcomes that could possibly be the future for marine fish larvae however, recent studies published in 2021 and 2022 suggest that the effects of ocean acidification on the behavior of fish larvae may not be universal or as severe as previously thought multiple studies published in 2009 and 2010 reported drastic effects of ocean acidification on the behavior of coral fish this led to more than a decade of research regarding the effects of ocean acidification on animal behavior, including fish and invertebrates however, a study in 2020 challenged the potential negative impact of end-of-century ocean acidification level on the coral fish behavior, reporting that the results of the aforementioned studies from 2009 to 2010 were not replicable and suggesting that the effect of acidification on fish behavior could be negligible furthermore, a meta-analysis published in 2022 found that the effect sizes of published studies testing for ocean acidification effects on fish behavior have declined by an order of magnitude over the past decade and have been negligible for the past five years, constituting a textbook example of the decline effect in science while the full implications of elevated co2 on marine ecosystems are still being documented, there is a substantial body of research showing that a combination of ocean acidification and elevated ocean temperature, driven mainly by co2 and other greenhouse gas emissions, have a compounded effect on marine life and the ocean environment this effect far exceeds the individual harmful impact of either in addition, ocean warming exacerbates ocean deoxygenation, which is an additional stressor on marine organisms, by increasing ocean stratification, through density and solubility effects, thus limiting nutrients, while at the same time increasing metabolic demand meta analyses have quantified the direction and magnitude of the harmful effects of ocean acidification, warming and deoxygenation on the ocean these meta-analyses have been further tested by mesocosm studies that simulated the interaction of these stressors and found a catastrophic effect on the marine food web, i e that the increases in consumption from thermal stress more than negates any primary producer to herbivore increase from elevated co2 leaving aside direct biological effects, it is expected that ocean acidification in the future will lead to a significant decrease in the burial of carbonate sediments for several centuries, and even the dissolution of existing carbonate sediments this will cause an elevation of ocean alkalinity, leading to the enhancement of the ocean as a reservoir for co2 with implications for climate change as more co2 leaves the atmosphere for the ocean the threat of acidification includes a decline in commercial fisheries and in the arctic tourism industry and economy commercial fisheries are threatened because acidification harms calcifying organisms which form the base of the arctic food webs pteropods and brittle stars both form the base of the arctic food webs and are both seriously damaged from acidification pteropods shells dissolve with increasing acidification and the brittle stars lose muscle mass when re-growing appendages for pteropods to create shells they require aragonite which is produced through carbonate ions and dissolved calcium pteropods are severely affected because increasing acidification levels have steadily decreased the amount of water supersaturated with carbonate which is needed for aragonite creation arctic waters are changing so rapidly that they will become undersaturated with aragonite as early as 2016 additionally the brittle star\\'s eggs die within a few days when exposed to expected conditions resulting from arctic acidification acidification threatens to destroy arctic food webs from the base up arctic food webs are considered simple, meaning there are few steps in the food chain from small organisms to larger predators for example, pteropods are \"a key prey item of a number of higher predators – larger plankton, fish, seabirds, whales\" both pteropods and sea stars serve as a substantial food source and their removal from the simple food web would pose a serious threat to the whole ecosystem the effects on the calcifying organisms at the base of the food webs could potentially destroy fisheries the value of fish caught from us commercial fisheries in 2007 was valued at $3 8\\xa0billion and of that 73% was derived from calcifiers and their direct predators other organisms are directly harmed as a result of acidification for example, decrease in the growth of marine calcifiers such as the american lobster, ocean quahog, and scallops means there is less shellfish meat available for sale and consumption red king crab fisheries are also at a serious threat because crabs are calcifiers and rely on carbonate ions for shell development baby red king crab when exposed to increased acidification levels experienced 100% mortality after 95\\xa0days in 2006, red king crab accounted for 23% of the total guideline harvest levels and a serious decline in red crab population would threaten the crab harvesting industry several ocean goods and services are likely to be undermined by future ocean acidification potentially affecting the livelihoods of some 400 to 800\\xa0million people depending upon the emission scenario acidification could damage the arctic tourism economy and affect the way of life of indigenous peoples a major pillar of arctic tourism is the sport fishing and hunting industry the sport fishing industry is threatened by collapsing food webs which provide food for the prized fish a decline in tourism lowers revenue input in the area, and threatens the economies that are increasingly dependent on tourism the rapid decrease or disappearance of marine life could also affect the diet of indigenous peoples members of the interacademy panel recommended that by 2050, global anthropogenic co2 emissions be reduced less than 50% of the 1990 level the 2009 statement also called on world leaders to:stabilizing atmospheric co2 concentrations at 450\\xa0ppm would require near-term emissions reductions, with steeper reductions over time the german advisory council on global change stated:in order to prevent disruption of the calcification of marine organisms and the resultant risk of fundamentally altering marine food webs, the following guard rail should be obeyed: the ph of near surface waters should not drop more than 0 2 units below the pre-industrial average value in any larger ocean region (nor in the global mean) one policy target related to ocean acidity is the magnitude of future global warming parties to the united nations framework convention on climate change (unfccc) adopted a target of limiting warming to below 2\\xa0°c, relative to the pre-industrial level meeting this target would require substantial reductions in anthropogenic co2 emissions limiting global warming to below 2\\xa0°c would imply a reduction in surface ocean ph of 0 16 from pre-industrial levels this would represent a substantial decline in surface ocean ph on 25 september 2015, usepa denied a 30 june 2015, citizens petition that asked epa to regulate co2 under tsca in order to mitigate ocean acidification in the denial, epa said that risks from ocean acidification were being \"more efficiently and effectively addressed\" under domestic actions, e g , under the presidential climate action plan, and that multiple avenues are being pursued to work with and in other nations to reduce emissions and deforestation and promote clean energy and energy efficiency on 28 march 2017 the us by executive order rescinded the climate action plan on 1\\xa0june 2017 it was announced the us would withdraw from the paris accords, and on 12\\xa0june 2017 that the us would abstain from the g7 climate change pledge, two major international efforts to reduce co2 emissions other solutions such as increasing the land devoted to forests and encouraging the growth of co2-breathing sea plants can mitigate ocean acidification geoengineering has been proposed as a possible response to ocean acidification the iap (2009) statement said more research is needed to prove that this would be safe, affordable and worthwhile:mitigation approaches such as adding chemicals to counter the effects of acidification are likely to be expensive, only partly effective and only at a very local scale, and may pose additional unanticipated risks to the marine environment there has been very little research on the feasibility and impacts of these approaches substantial research is needed before these techniques could be applied reports by the wgbu (2006), the uk\\'s royal society (2009), and the us national research council (2011) warned of the potential risks and difficulties associated with climate engineering iron fertilization of the ocean could stimulate photosynthesis in phytoplankton (see iron hypothesis) the phytoplankton would convert the ocean\\'s dissolved carbon dioxide into carbohydrate and oxygen gas, some of which would sink into the deeper ocean before oxidizing more than a dozen open-sea experiments confirmed that adding iron to the ocean increases photosynthesis in phytoplankton by up to 30 times while this approach has been proposed as a potential solution to the ocean acidification problem, mitigation of surface ocean acidification might increase acidification in the less-inhabited deep ocean a report by the uk\\'s royal society (2009) reviewed the approach for effectiveness, affordability, timeliness and safety the rating for affordability was \"medium\", or \"not expected to be very cost-effective\" for the other three criteria, the ratings ranged from \"low\" to \"very low\" (i e , not good) for example, in regards to safety, the report found a \"[high] potential for undesirable ecological side effects\", and that ocean fertilization \"may increase anoxic regions of ocean (\\'dead zones\\')\" the problem of ocean acidification is included in one of the targets of the united nations\\' sustainable development goal 14: ocean acidification is directly addressed by the target sdg 14 3 the full title of target 14 3 is: \"minimize and address the impacts of ocean acidification, including through enhanced scientific cooperation at all levels\" this target has one indicator: indicator 14 3 1 is the \"average marine acidity (ph) measured at agreed suite of representative sampling stations\" ocean acidification has occurred previously in earth\\'s history, and the resulting ecological collapse in the oceans had long-lasting effects on global carbon cycling and climate the most notable example is the paleocene–eocene thermal maximum (petm), which occurred approximately 56\\xa0million years ago when massive amounts of carbon entered the ocean and atmosphere, and led to the dissolution of carbonate sediments in all ocean basins three of the big five mass extinction events in the geologic past were associated with a rapid increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide, probably due to volcanism and/or thermal dissociation of marine gas hydrates early research focused on the climatic effects of the elevated co2 levels on biodiversity, but in 2004, decreased caco3 saturation due to seawater uptake of volcanogenic co2 was suggested as a possible kill mechanism during the marine mass extinction at the end of the triassic the end-triassic biotic crisis is still the most well-established example of a marine mass extinction due to ocean acidification, because (a) volcanic activity, changes in carbon isotopes, decrease of carbonate sedimentation, and marine extinction coincided precisely in the stratigraphic record, and (b) there was pronounced selectivity of the extinction against organisms with thick aragonitic skeletons, which is predicted from experimental studies ocean acidification has also been suggested as a cause of the end-permian mass extinction and the end-cretaceous crisis \"present day\" (1990s)

are difficult to forecast exactly researchers have warned that current economic modelling may seriously underestimate the effects of climate change, and point to the need for new models that give a more accurate picture of potential damages nevertheless, one 2018 study found that potential global economic gains if countries implement mitigation strategies to comply with the 2\\xa0°c target set at the paris agreement are in the vicinity of us$17 trillion per year up to 2100 compared to a very high emission scenario global losses reveal rapidly rising costs due to extreme weather events since the 1970s socio-economic factors have contributed to the observed trend of global losses, such as population growth and increased wealth part of the growth is also related to regional climatic factors, e g , changes in precipitation and flooding events it is difficult to quantify the relative impact of socio-economic factors and climate change on the observed trend the trend does, however, suggest increasing vulnerability of social systems to climate change a 2019 modelling study found that climate change had contributed towards global economic inequality wealthy countries in colder regions had either felt little overall economic impact from climate change, or possibly benefited, whereas poor hotter countries very likely grew less than if global warming had not occurred the total economic impacts from climate change are difficult to estimate, but increase for higher temperature changes for instance, total damages are estimated to be 90% less if global warming is limited to 1 5\\xa0°c compared to 3 66\\xa0°c, a warming level chosen to represent no mitigation one study found a 3 5% reduction in global gdp by the end of the century if warming is limited to 3\\xa0°c, excluding the potential effect of tipping points another study noted that global economic impact is underestimated by a factor of two to eight when tipping points are excluded from consideration in the oxford economics high emission scenario, a temperature rise of 2 degrees by the year 2050 would reduce global gdp by 2 5% – 7 5% by the year 2100 in this case, the temperature would rise by 4 degrees, which could reduce the global gdp by 30% in the worst case the economic impacts of climate change also include any mitigation (for example, limiting the global average temperature below 2\\xa0°c) or adaption (for example, building flood defences) employed by nations or groups of nations, which might infer economic consequences climate change impacts can be measured as an economic cost (smith et al , 2001:936-941) this is particularly well-suited to market impacts, that is impacts that are linked to market transactions and directly affect gdp monetary measures of non-market impacts, e g , impacts on human health and ecosystems, are more difficult to calculate other difficulties with impact estimates are listed below:in a literature assessment, smith et al (2001:957-958) concluded, with medium confidence, that:with high confidence, it was predicted that with a medium (2-3\\xa0°c) to high level of warming (greater than 3\\xa0°c), negative impacts would be exacerbated, and net positive impacts would start to decline and eventually turn negative green companies in europe outperform those in the united states in terms of green investment and digital uptake in comparison to the united states, european businesses are less likely to have adopted digital technology, but they are more likely to invest in climate change mitigation or adaptation strategies in europe, the proportion of businesses that make green investments and are also digital adopters is slightly greater, at 32% the same businesses are at 28% in the united states 81% of the european investment bank\\'s investment survey respondents cited uncertainty as the most severe obstacle to investment a european survey conducted in 2021 found that 45% of young chinese people, 32% of young americans, 31% of british, and 25% of europeans fear they could lose their jobs because of the fight against climate change specifically, europeans aged 20 - 29 (44%) fear they could lose their job if it is incompatible with the need to combat climate change however, 55% of europeans believe that initiatives to combat climate change will have a net positive impact on employment, generating more jobs the survey also found that 69% of eu, 71% of uk, 62% of us and 89% of chinese respondents would support a tax on the items and services that contribute the most to climate change smith et al (2001:942) predicted that climate change would likely result in pronounced non-market impacts most of impacts were predicted to be negative the literature assessment by smith et al (2001) suggested that climate change would cause substantial negative health impacts in developing countries smith et al (2001) noted that few of the studies they reviewed had adequately accounted for adaptation in a literature assessment, confalonieri et al (2007:415) found that in the studies that had included health impacts, those impacts contributed substantially to the total costs of climate change in 2019 the international labour organization published a report titled: \"working on a warmer planet: the impact of heat stress on labour productivity and decent work\", in which it claims that even if the rise in temperature will be limited to 1 5 degree, by the year 2030, climate change will cause losses in productivity reaching 2 2% of all the working hours, every year this is equivalent to 80 million full time jobs, or 2,400 billion dollars the sector expected to be most affected is agriculture, which is projected to account for 60% of this loss the construction sector is also projected to be severely impacted and accounts for 19% of projected losses other sectors that are most at risk are environmental goods and services, refuse collection, emergency, repair work, transport, tourism, sports and some forms of industrial work in 2020 mckinsey & company issued a report about the current and future impacts of climate change on the economy the report says that trillions of dollars and hundreds of millions of lives are at risk climate change should strongly influence the decisions of the business and governmental leaders the report, for example, found that socioeconomic impacts can increase by 2 - 20 times compare to today level by 2050 climate change driven migration possibly helped to trigger brexit - the exit of britain from european union the uncertainty about brexit has shrunk the british economy in 2019, and may cause it to contract further in the future brexit can make it shrink it much more in the european investment bank\\'s investment report 2020-2021, it was found that climate change and related weather events have had a significant influence on 23% of european companies, compared to 14% in the united states another 35% of european companies consider the consequences of climate change to be minimal depending on underlying assumptions, studies of the economic impacts of a doubling in atmospheric carbon dioxide (co2) from pre-industrial levels conclude that this would have a slightly negative to moderately positive aggregate effect (i e , total impacts across all regions) on the agricultural sector (smith et al , 2001:938) this aggregate effect hides substantial regional differences, with benefits mostly predicted in the developed world and strongly negative impacts for populations poorly connected to regional and global trading systems poorer countries are more exposed to the weather because of the important role of agriculture and water resources in the economy a number of other sectors will be affected by climate change, including the livestock, forestry, and fisheries industries other sectors sensitive to climate change include the energy, insurance, tourism and recreation industries the aggregate impact of climate change on most of these sectors is highly uncertain (schneider et al , 2007:790) \"although greenhouse gas emissions per person are higher in high-income countries, relative impacts of climate change are greater in low-income countries\" this is because \"low-income countries tend to be in tropical zones closer to the equator\" and, due to their economic position, \\'low-income\\' are less able to adapt aggregating impacts adds up the total impact of climate change across sectors and/or regions (ipcc, 2007a:76) in producing aggregate impacts, there are a number of difficulties, such as predicting the ability of societies to adapt climate change, and estimating how future economic and social development will progress (smith et al , 2001:941) it is also necessary for the researcher to make subjective value judgements over the importance of impacts occurring in different economic sectors, in different regions, and at different times in 2020 the world economic forum ranked climate change as the biggest risk to economy and society a united states government report in november 2018 raised the possibility of us gdp going down 10% as a result of the warming climate, including huge shifts in geography, demographics and technology smith et al (2001) assessed the literature on the aggregate impacts of climate change with medium confidence, they concluded that a small increase in global average temperature (up to 2\\xa0°c, measured against 1990 levels) would result in an aggregate market sector impact of plus or minus a few percent of world gdp smith et al (2001) found that for a small to medium (2-3\\xa0°c) global average temperature increase, some studies predicted small net positive market impacts most studies they assessed predicted net damages beyond a medium temperature increase, with further damages for greater (more than 3\\xa0°c) temperature rises with low confidence, smith et al (2001) concluded that the non-market impacts of climate change would be negative smith et al (2001:942) decided that studies might have understated the true costs of climate change, e g , by not correctly estimating the impact of extreme weather events it was thought possible that some of the positive impacts of climate change had been overlooked, and that adaptive capacity had possibly been underestimated some of the studies assessed by schneider et al (2007:790) predicted that gross world product could increase for 1-3\\xa0°c warming (relative to temperatures over the 1990-2000 period), largely because of aggregate benefits in the agricultural sector in the view of schneider et al (2007), these estimates carried low confidence stern (2007) assessed climate change impacts using the basic economics of risk premiums (yohe et al , 2007:821) he found that unmitigated climate change could result in a reduction in welfare equivalent to a persistent average fall in global per-capita consumption of at least 5% the study by stern (2007) has received both criticism and support from other economists (see stern review for more information) ipcc (2007a) concluded that \"aggregate estimates of costs mask significant differences in impacts across sectors, regions and populations and very likely underestimate damage costs because they cannot include many non-quantifiable impacts \"richard s tol has twice revised his figure incorporated as fig 10-1 in ipcc reports from his \"the economic effects of climate change\" in the second revision he says \"the ipcc discussion of this figure offers some useful cautions about interpretation:\" and quotes that as saying:\"estimates agree on the size of the impact (small relative to economic growth), and 17 of the 20 impact estimates shown in figure 10-1 are negative losses accelerate with greater warming, and estimates diverge the new estimates have slightly widened the uncertainty about the economic impacts of climate welfare impacts have been estimated with different methods, ranging from expert elicitation to econometric studies and simulation models different studies include different aspects of the impacts of climate change, but no estimate is complete; most experts speculate that excluded impacts are on balance negative estimates across the studies reflect different assumptions about inter-sectoral, inter-regional, and inter-temporal interactions, about adaptation, and about the monetary values of impacts aggregate estimates of costs mask significant differences in impacts across sectors, regions, countries, and populations relative to their income, economic impacts are higher for poorer people \"the social cost of carbon (scc) is an aggregate measure of the impacts of climate change it is defined as the incremental (or marginal) social cost of emitting one more tonne of carbon (as carbon dioxide) into the atmosphere at any point in time (yohe et al , 2007:821) different ghgs have different social costs for example, due to their greater physical capacity to trap infrared radiation, hfcs have a considerably higher social cost per tonne of emission than carbon dioxide another physical property that affects the social cost is the atmospheric lifetime of the ghg estimates of the scc are highly uncertain and cover a wide range (klein et al , 2007:756) the discrepancies in estimates can be broken down into normative and empirical parameters (fisher et al , 2007:232) key normative parameters include the aggregation of impacts across time and regions the other parameters relate to the empirical validity of scc estimates this reflects the poor quality of data on which estimates are based, and the difficulty in predicting how society will react to future climate change in a literature assessment, klein et al (2007:757) placed low confidence in scc estimates sensitivity analysis allows assumptions to be changed in aggregate analysis to see what effect it has on results (smith et al , 2001:943):there are a number of benefits of using aggregated assessments to measure climate change impacts (smith et al , 2001:954) they allow impacts to be directly compared between different regions and times impacts can be compared with other environmental problems and also with the costs of avoiding those impacts a problem of aggregated analyses is that they often reduce different types of impacts into a small number of indicators it can be argued that some impacts are not well-suited to this, e g , the monetization of mortality and loss of species diversity on the other hand, pearce (2003:364) argued that where there are monetary costs of avoiding impacts, it is not possible to avoid monetary valuation of those impacts as stated, economic estimates of climate change impacts are incomplete analysts have used integrated assessment models to estimate the economic impacts of climate change these models do include estimates of some impacts, for instance, the effects of climate change on agriculture in other areas, models exclude some impacts an example is the possibility that climate change could lead to migration or conflict the stern review for the british government also predicted that world gdp would be reduced by several percent due to climate related costs however, their calculations may omit ecological effects that are difficult to quantify economically (such as human deaths or loss of biodiversity) or whose economic consequences will manifest slowly therefore, their calculations may be an underestimate the effects of climate change can be compared to other effects on human society and the environment future socio-economic development may strongly affect climate change impacts for example, projections of the number of people at risk of hunger vary significantly according to assumptions over future socio-economic development some ecosystems are likely to be especially affected by climate change (e g , coral reefs) in the long-term (beyond 2050), climate change may become the major driver for biodiversity loss globally the socio-economic impacts of climate change are likely to be greatest in communities that face other stresses for example, poor communities are vulnerable to extreme weather events, and are likely to be especially affected by climate change in general, however, other changes (e g , demographic and technological) are likely to have a greater effect on human society than climate change on the other hand, major (\"non-marginal\") impacts could occur with abrupt changes in natural and social systems scientific understanding of abrupt changes is limited another consideration is how vulnerability to climate change varies with scale at local scales, extreme weather events can have a significant impact, especially in vulnerable locations another potentially significant impact is the long-term effect of sea-level rise on low-lying coastal areas bostrom (2009) comments that:even the stern review on the economics of climate change, a report prepared for the british government which has been criticized by some as overly pessimistic, estimates that under the assumption of business-as-usual with regard to emissions, global warming will reduce welfare by an amount equivalent to a permanent reduction in per capita consumption of between 5 and 20% in absolute terms, this would be a huge harm yet over the course of the twentieth century, world gdp grew by some 3,700%, and per capita world gdp rose by some 860% it seems safe to say that (absent a radical overhaul of our best current scientific models of the earth’s climate system) whatever negative economic effects global warming will have, they will be completely swamped by other factors that will influence economic growth rates in this century other analysts have commented on the risks of climate change damages the german advisory council on global change (wbgu, 2007) comments that:although [the stern review\\'s] figures tend to be at the upper end of the scale compared to other estimates currently circulating, even [its] quantitative estimates fail to include the economic upheavals that would arise as a consequence of climate-induced conflicts or might be triggered by climate-induced migration several analysts have emphasized the importance of \"catastrophic\" risks due to climate change wbgu (2007) states that due to climate change, \"significant impairment\" of the global economy is a \"distinct possibility\" weitzman (2012) has commented:climate change potentially affects the whole worldwide portfolio of utility by threatening to drive all of planetary welfare to disastrously low levels in the most extreme scenarios with global climate change, diversification [of risk] is limited because all eggs are inherently in one basket in 2017, climate change contributed to extreme weather events causing at least $100 billion in damages the impact can be seen over a longer time period, where \"over the past 20 years, an estimated 500,000 people have died and us$3 5 trillion was lost as a result of extreme weather events\" increasing temperature will lead to accelerating economic losses :\\u200a16\\u200a a 2017 survey of independent economists looking at the effects of climate change found that future damage estimates range \"from 2% to 10% or more of global gdp per year \"environmental migrants are people who are forced to leave their home region due to sudden or long-term changes to their local or regional environment these changes compromise their well-being or livelihood, and include increased drought, desertification, sea level rise, and disruption of seasonal weather patterns (such as monsoons) though there is no uniform, clear-cut definition of environmental migration, the idea is gaining attention as policy-makers and environmental and social scientists attempt to conceptualize the potential social effects of climate change and other environmental degradation, such a deforestation or overexploitation \"environmental migrant\" and \"climate migrant\" (or \"climate refugee\") are used somewhat interchangeably with a range of similar terms, such as ecological refugee, environmental refugee, forced environmental migrant, environmentally motivated migrant, environmentally displaced person (edp), disaster refugee, environmental displacee, eco-refugee, ecologically displaced person, or environmental-refugee-to-be (ertb) the distinctions between these terms remain contested the vast majority of people fleeing environmental distress migrate over short distances, often temporarily moreover, the refugees aren\\'t leaving their homes because of fear they will be persecuted, or because of \"generalized violence or events seriously disturbing public order \" even though the definition of who is a refugee was expanded since its first international and legally binding definition in 1951 people who are forced to flee due to environmental change are still not offered the same legal protection as refugees the term \"environmental refugee\" was first proposed by lester brown in 1976 the international organization for migration (iom) proposes the following definition for environmental migrants:\"environmental migrants are persons or groups of persons who, for compelling reasons of sudden or progressive changes in the environment that adversely affect their lives or living conditions, are obliged to leave their habitual homes, or choose to do so, either temporarily or permanently, and who move either within their country or abroad \"climate migrants are a subset of environmental migrants who were forced to flee \"due to sudden or gradual alterations in the natural environment related to at least one of three impacts of climate change: sea-level rise, extreme weather events, and drought and water scarcity \"the international organisation for migration proposes three types of environmental migrants:other scholars have proposed various other types of migrant including:there have been a number of attempts over the decades to enumerate environmental migrants and refugees jodi jacobson (1988) is cited as the first researcher to enumerate the issue, stating that there were already up to 10 million \\'environmental refugees\\' drawing on \\'worst-case scenarios\\' about sea-level rise, she argued that all forms of \\'environmental refugees\\' would be six times as numerous as political refugees by 1989, mustafa tolba, executive director of united nations environment programme, was claiming that \\'as many as 50 million people could become environmental refugees\\' if the world did not act to support sustainable development in the mid-1990s, british environmentalist, norman myers, became the most prominent proponent of this \\'maximalist\\' school (suhrke 1993), noting that \"environmental refugees will soon become the largest group of involuntary refugees\" additionally, he stated that there were 25 million environmental refugees in the mid-1990s, further claiming that this figure could double by 2010, with an upper limit of 200 million by 2050 (myers 1997) myers argued that the causes of environmental displacement would include desertification, lack of water, salination of irrigated lands and the depletion of biodiversity he also hypothesised that displacement would amount to 30m in china, 30m in india, 15m in bangladesh, 14m in egypt, 10m in other delta areas and coastal zones, 1m in island states, and with otherwise agriculturally displaced people totalling 50m by 2050 more recently, myers has suggested that the figure by 2050 might be as high as 250 million norman myers is the most cited researcher in this field, who found that 25 million environmental migrants existed in 1995 in his work (myers & kent 1995), which drew upon over 1000 sources however, vikram kolmannskog has stated that myers\\' work can be \\'criticized for being inconsistent, impossible to check and failing to take proper account of opportunities to adapt\\' (2008: 9) furthermore, myers himself has acknowledged that his figures are based upon \\'heroic extrapolation\\' (brown 2008: 12) more generally, black has argued that there is \\'surprisingly little scientific evidence\\' that indicates that the world is \\'filling-up with environmental refugees\\' (1998: 23) the notion of \\'environmental migrant\\' has been a part of popular culture at least since the grapes of wrath, a 1939 novel by john steinbeck extreme weather or extreme climate events includes unexpected, unusual, severe, or unseasonal weather; weather at the extremes of the historical distribution—the range that has been seen in the past often, extreme events are based on a location\\'s recorded weather history and defined as lying in the most unusual ten percent the main types of extreme weather include heat waves, cold waves and tropical cyclones the effects of extreme weather events are seen in rising economic costs, loss of human lives, droughts, floods, landslides and changes in ecosystems there is evidence to suggest that climate change is increasing the periodicity and intensity of some extreme weather events confidence in the attribution of extreme weather and other events to anthropogenic climate change is highest in changes in frequency or magnitude of extreme heat and cold events with some confidence in increases in heavy precipitation and increases in the intensity of droughts current evidence and climate models show that an increasing global temperature will intensify extreme weather events around the globe, thereby amplifying human loss, damages and economic costs, and ecosystem destruction extreme weather has significant impacts on human society as well as natural ecosystems for example, a global insurer munich re estimates that natural disasters cause more than $90 billion global direct losses in 2015 some human activities can exacerbate the effects, for example some forms of urban planning, wetland destruction along the coast, building homes along a floodplain definitions of extreme weather vary in different parts of the scientific community, changing the outcomes of research from those fields heat waves are periods of abnormally high temperatures and heat index definitions of a heatwave vary because of the variation of temperatures in different geographic locations excessive heat is often accompanied by high levels of humidity, but can also be catastrophically dry because heat waves are not visible as other forms of severe weather are, like hurricanes, tornadoes, and thunderstorms, they are one of the less known forms of extreme weather severe heat weather can damage populations and crops due to potential dehydration or hyperthermia, heat cramps, heat expansion, and heat stroke dried soils are more susceptible to erosion, decreasing lands available for agriculture outbreaks of wildfires can increase in frequency as dry vegetation has increased the likeliness of igniting the evaporation of bodies of water can be devastating to marine populations, decreasing the size of the habitats available as well as the amount of nutrition present within the waters livestock and other animal populations may decline as well during excessive heat, plants shut their leaf pores (stomata), a protective mechanism to conserve water but also curtails plants\\' absorption capabilities this leaves more pollution and ozone in the air, which leads to higher mortality in the population it has been estimated that extra pollution during the hot summer of 2006 in the uk, cost 460 lives the european heat waves from summer 2003 are estimated to have caused 30,000 excess deaths, due to heat stress and air pollution over 200 u s cities have registered new record high temperatures the worst heat wave in the usa occurred in 1936 and killed more than 5000 people directly the worst heat wave in australia occurred in 1938–39 and killed 438 the second worst was in 1896 power outages can also occur within areas experiencing heat waves due to the increased demand for electricity (i e air conditioning use) the urban heat island effect can increase temperatures, particularly overnight a cold wave is a weather phenomenon that is distinguished by a cooling of the air specifically, as used by the u s national weather service, a cold wave is a rapid fall in temperature within a 24-hour period requiring substantially increased protection to agriculture, industry, commerce, and social activities the precise criterion for a cold wave is determined by the rate at which the temperature falls, and the minimum to which it falls this minimum temperature is dependent on the geographical region and time of year cold waves generally are capable of occurring at any geological location and are formed by large cool air masses that accumulate over certain regions, caused by movements of air streams a cold wave can cause death and injury to livestock and wildlife exposure to cold mandates greater caloric intake for all animals, including humans, and if a cold wave is accompanied by heavy and persistent snow, grazing animals may be unable to reach necessary food and water, and die of hypothermia or starvation cold waves often necessitate the purchase of fodder for livestock at considerable cost to farmers human populations can be inflicted with frostbite when exposed for extended periods of time to cold and may result in the loss of limbs or damage to internal organs extreme winter cold often causes poorly insulated water pipes to freeze even some poorly protected indoor plumbing may rupture as frozen water expands within them, causing property damage fires, paradoxically, become more hazardous during extreme cold water mains may break and water supplies may become unreliable, making firefighting more difficult cold waves that bring unexpected freezes and frosts during the growing season in mid-latitude zones can kill plants during the early and most vulnerable stages of growth this results in crop failure as plants are killed before they can be harvested economically such cold waves have caused famines cold waves can also cause soil particles to harden and freeze, making it harder for plants and vegetation to grow within these areas one extreme was the so-called year without a summer of 1816, one of several years during the 1810s in which numerous crops failed during freakish summer cold snaps after volcanic eruptions reduced incoming sunlight in some cases more frequent extremely cold winter weather – i e across parts of asia and north america  including the february 2021 north american cold wave – can be a result of climate change such as due to changes in the arctic however, conclusions that link climate change to cold waves are considered to still be controversial [unreliable source?][additional citation(s) needed] the jrc peseta iv project concluded in 2020 that overall climate change will result in a decline in the intensity and frequency of extreme cold spells, with milder winters reducing fatalities from extreme cold,[additional citation(s) needed] even if individual cold extreme weather may sometimes be caused by changes due to climate change and possibly even become more frequent in some regions a tropical cyclone is a rapidly rotating storm system characterized by a low-pressure center, a closed low-level atmospheric circulation, strong winds, and a spiral arrangement of thunderstorms that produce heavy rain and/or squalls depending on its location and strength, a tropical cyclone is referred to by different names, including hurricane (/ˈhʌrɪkən, -keɪn/), typhoon (/taɪˈfuːn/), tropical storm, cyclonic storm, tropical depression, or simply cyclone:[citation needed] a hurricane is a strong tropical cyclone that occurs in the atlantic ocean or northeastern pacific ocean, and a typhoon occurs in the northwestern pacific ocean; in the indian ocean, south pacific, or (rarely) south atlantic, comparable storms are referred to simply as \"tropical cyclones\", and such storms in the indian ocean can also be called \"severe cyclonic storms\" \"tropical\" refers to the geographical origin of these systems, which form almost exclusively over tropical seas \"cyclone\" refers to their winds moving in a circle, whirling round their central clear eye, with their winds blowing counterclockwise in the northern hemisphere and clockwise in the southern hemisphere the opposite direction of circulation is due to the coriolis effect tropical cyclones typically form over large bodies of relatively warm water they derive their energy through the evaporation of water from the ocean surface, which ultimately condenses into clouds and rain when moist air rises and cools to saturation this energy source differs from that of mid-latitude cyclonic storms, such as nor\\'easters and european windstorms, which are fueled primarily by horizontal temperature contrasts tropical cyclones are typically between 100 and 2,000\\xa0km (62 and 1,243\\xa0mi) in diameter every year tropical cyclones impact various regions of the globe including the gulf coast of north america, australia, india and bangladesh in 2020, the national oceanic and atmospheric administration (noaa) of the u s government predicted that, over the 21st century, the frequency of tropical storms and atlantic hurricanes would decline by 25 percent while their maximum intensity would rise 5 percent prior to the new study there was a decade-long debate about a possible increase of tropical cyclones as an effect of climate change however, the 2012 ipcc special report on extreme events srex states that \"there is low confidence in any observed long-term (i e , 40 years or more) increases in tropical cyclone activity (i e , intensity, frequency, duration), after accounting for past changes in observing capabilities \" increases in population densities increase the number of people affected and damage caused by an event of given severity the world meteorological organization and the u s environmental protection agency have in the past linked increasing extreme weather events to climate change, as have hoyos et al (2006), writing that the increasing number of category 4 and 5 hurricanes is directly linked to increasing temperatures similarly, kerry emanuel in nature writes that hurricane power dissipation is highly correlated with temperature, reflecting climate change hurricane modeling has produced similar results, finding that hurricanes, simulated under warmer, high co2 conditions, are more intense than under present-day conditions thomas knutson and robert e tuleya of the noaa stated in 2004 that warming-induced by greenhouse gas may lead to the increasing occurrence of highly destructive category-5 storms vecchi and soden find that wind shear, the increase of which acts to inhibit tropical cyclones, also changes in model-projections of climate change there are projected increases of wind shear in the tropical atlantic and east pacific associated with the deceleration of the walker circulation, as well as decreases of wind shear in the western and central pacific the study does not make claims about the net effect on atlantic and east pacific hurricanes of the warming and moistening atmospheres, and the model-projected increases in atlantic wind shear the effects of extreme weather includes, but not limited to:according to ipcc (2011) estimates of annual losses have ranged since 1980 from a few billion to above us$200 billion (in 2010 dollars), with the highest value for 2005 (the year of hurricane katrina) the global weather-related disaster losses, such as loss of human lives, cultural heritage, and ecosystem services, are difficult to value and monetize, and thus they are poorly reflected in estimates of losses yet, recent abnormally intense storms, hurricanes, floods, heatwaves, droughts and associated large-scale wildfires have led to unprecedented negative ecological consequences for tropical forests and coral reefs around the world the death toll from natural disasters has declined over 90 percent since the 1920s, according to the international disaster database, even as the total human population on earth quadrupled, and temperatures rose 1 3\\xa0°c in the 1920s, 5 4 million people died from natural disasters while in the 2010s, just 400,000 did the most dramatic and rapid declines in deaths from extreme weather events have taken place in south asia where a tropical cyclone in 1991 in bangladesh killed 135,000 people, and a 1970 cyclone killed 300,000, the similarly-sized cyclone ampham, which struck india and bangladesh in 2020, killed just 120 people in total in the united states, major hurricanes can produce flooding from storm surges and extreme rainfall and account for 75% of all fatalities on july 23, 2020, munich re announced that the 2,900 total global deaths from natural disasters for the first half of 2020 was a record-low, and “much lower than the average figures for both the last 30 years and the last 10 years ”a 2021 study found that 9 4% of global deaths between 2000 and 2019 – ~5 million annually – can be attributed to extreme temperature with cold-related ones making up the larger share and decreasing and heat-related ones making up ~0 91\\xa0% and increasing climate change has led to an increase in the frequency and/or intensity of certain types of extreme weather storms such as hurricanes or tropical cyclones may experience greater rainfall, causing major flooding events or landslides by saturating soil this is because warmer air is able to ‘hold’ more moisture due to the water molecules having increased kinetic energy, and precipitation occurs at a greater rate because more molecules have the critical speed needed to fall as rain drops a shift in rainfall patterns can lead to greater amounts of precipitation in one area while another experiences much hotter, drier conditions, which can lead to drought this is because an increase in temperatures also lead to an increase in evaporation at the surface of the earth, so more precipitation does not necessarily mean universally wetter conditions or a worldwide increase in drinking water extreme weather negatively affects the ecosystems through various events resulting the serious impact on the landscape and people there are plenty of anthropogenic activities that can exacerbate the effects of extreme weather events urban planning often amplifies urban flooding impacts, especially in areas that are at increased risk of storms due to their location and climate variability first, increasing the amount of impervious surfaces, such as sidewalks, roads, and roofs, means that less of the water from incoming storms is absorbed by the land the destruction of wetlands, which act as a natural reservoir by absorbing water, can intensify the impact of floods and extreme precipitation this can happen both inland and at the coast however, wetland destruction along the coast can mean decreasing an area’s natural ‘cushion,’ thus allowing storm surges and flood waters to reach farther inland during hurricanes or cyclones building homes below sea level or along a floodplain puts residents at increased risk of destruction or injury in an extreme precipitation event more urban areas can also contribute to the rise of extreme or unusual weather events tall structures can alter the way that wind moves throughout an urban area, pushing warmer air upwards and inducing convection, creating thunderstorms with these thunderstorms comes increased precipitation, which, because of the large amounts of impervious surfaces in cities, can have devastating impacts impervious surfaces also absorb energy from the sun and warm the atmosphere, causing drastic increases in temperatures in urban areas this, along with pollution and heat released from cars and other anthropogenic sources, contributes to urban heat islands generally speaking, one event in extreme weather cannot be attributed to any one cause; however, certain system wide changes to global weather systems can lead to increased frequency or intensity of extreme weather events aspects of our climate system have a certain level of natural variability, and extreme weather events can occur for several reasons beyond human impact, including changes in pressure or the movement of air areas along the coast or located in tropical regions are more likely to experience storms with heavy precipitation than temperate regions, although such events can occur not every unusual weather event can be blamed on climate change the atmosphere is a complex and dynamic system, influenced by several factors such as the natural tilt and orbit of the earth, the absorption or reflection of solar radiation, the movement of air masses, and the hydrologic cycle due to this, weather patterns can experience some variation, and so extreme weather can be attributed, at least in part, to the natural variability that exists on earth climatic variations such as the el niño-southern oscillation or the north atlantic oscillation impact weather patterns in specific regions of the world, influencing temperature and precipitation the record-breaking extreme weather events that have been catalogued throughout the past two hundred years most likely arise when climate patterns like enso or nao work “in the same direction as human‐induced warming \"some studies assert a connection between rapidly warming arctic temperatures and thus a vanishing cryosphere to extreme weather in mid-latitudes in a study published in nature in 2019, scientists used several simulations to determine that the melting of ice sheets in greenland and antarctica could affect overall sea level and sea temperature other models have shown that modern temperature rise and the subsequent addition of meltwater to the ocean could lead to a disruption of the thermohaline circulation, which is responsible for the movement of seawater and distribution of heat around the globe a collapse of this circulation in the northern hemisphere could lead to an increase in extreme temperatures in europe, as well as more frequent storms by throwing off natural climate variability and conditions thus, as increasing temperatures cause glaciers to melt, mid-latitudes could experience shifts in weather patterns or temperatures the increasing probability of record week-long heat extremes occurrence depends on warming rate, rather than global warming level there were around 6,681 climate-related events reported during 2000-2019, compared to 3,656 climate-related events reported during 1980-1999 in this report, a ‘climate-related event’ refers to floods, storms, droughts, landslides, extreme temperatures (like heat waves or freezes), and wildfires; it excludes geophysical events such as volcanic eruptions, earthquakes, or mass movements while there is evidence that a changing global climate, such as an increase in temperature, has impacted the frequency of extreme weather events, the most significant effects are likely to arise in the future this is where climate models are useful, for they can provide simulations on how the atmosphere may behave over time and what steps need to be taken in the present day to mitigate any negative changes some researchers attribute increases in extreme weather occurrences to more reliable reporting systems a difference in what qualifies as ‘extreme weather’ in varying climate systems could also be argued over or under reporting of casualties or losses can lead to inaccuracy in the impact of extreme weather however, the un reports show that, although some countries have experienced greater effects, there have been increases in extreme weather events on all continents current evidence and climate models show that an increasing global temperature will intensify extreme weather events around the globe, thereby amplifying human loss, damages and economic costs, and ecosystem destruction early research in extreme weather focused on statements about predicting certain events contemporary research focuses more on attribution of causes to trends in events in particular the field is focusing on climate change alongside other causal factors for these events a 2016 report from the national academies of sciences, engineering, and medicine, recommended investing in improved shared practices across the field working on attribution research, improving the connection between research outcomes and weather forecasting as more research is done in this area, scientists have begun to investigate the connection between climate change and extreme weather events and what future impacts may arise much of this work is done through climate modeling climate models provide important predictions about the future characteristics of the atmosphere, oceans, and earth using data collected in the modern day however, while climate models are vital for studying more complex processes such as climate change or ocean acidification, they are still only approximations moreover, weather events are complex and cannot be tied to a singular cause—there are often many atmospheric variables such as temperature, pressure, or moisture to note on top of any influences from climate change or natural variability an important record of extreme weather events is gathered statistics from around the world, which can help scientists and policymakers to have a better understanding of any changes in weather and climate conditions these statistics can influence climate modeling as well statistics have shown an increase in extreme weather events throughout the 1900s and into the 2000s a heat wave, or heatwave, is a period of excessively hot weather, which may be accompanied by high humidity, especially in oceanic climate countries while definitions vary, a heat wave is usually measured relative to the usual weather in the area and relative to normal temperatures for the season temperatures that people from a hotter climate consider normal can be called a heat wave in a cooler area if they are outside the normal climate pattern for that area the term is applied both to hot weather variations and to extraordinary spells of hot weather which may occur only once a century severe heat waves have caused catastrophic crop failures, thousands of deaths from hyperthermia, increased risk of wildfires in areas with drought, and widespread power outages due to increased use of air conditioning a heat wave is considered extreme weather, and poses danger to human health because heat and sunlight overwhelm the human body\\'s cooling system heat waves can usually be detected using forecasting instruments so that a warning can be issued heatwaves have become more frequent, and over land more intense, almost everywhere since the 1950s, due to climate change heatwaves often have complex effects on human economies, due to less productivity of workers, disruption of agricultural and industrial processes and damage to infrastructure not adapted for extreme heat recent projections suggest heatwaves alone will cause  ~1% decrease of gdp to economies by mid 21st century a definition based on frich et al \\'s heat wave duration index is that a heat wave occurs when the daily maximum temperature of more than five consecutive days exceeds the average maximum temperature by 5\\xa0°c (9\\xa0°f), the normal period being 1961–1990 a formal, peer-reviewed definition from the glossary of meteorology is:a period of abnormally and uncomfortably hot and usually humid weather the world meteorological organization, defines a heat wave as five or more consecutive days of prolonged heat in which the daily maximum temperature is higher than the average maximum temperature by 5\\xa0°c (9\\xa0°f) or more however, some nations have come up with their own criteria to define a heat wave in the netherlands, a heat wave is defined as a period of at least five consecutive days in which the maximum temperature in de bilt exceeds 25\\xa0°c (77\\xa0°f), provided that on at least three days in this period the maximum temperature in de bilt exceeds 30\\xa0°c (86\\xa0°f) this definition of a heat wave is also used in belgium and luxembourg in denmark, a national heat wave (hedebølge) is defined as a period of at least 3 consecutive days of which period the average maximum temperature across more than fifty percent of the country exceeds 28\\xa0°c (82 4\\xa0°f) – the danish meteorological institute further defines a \"warmth wave\" (varmebølge) when the same criteria are met for a 25\\xa0°c (77 0\\xa0°f) temperature, while in sweden, a heat wave is defined as at least five days in a row with a daily high exceeding 25\\xa0°c (77 0\\xa0°f) in the united states, definitions also vary by region; however, a heat wave is usually defined as a period of at least two or more days of excessively hot weather in the northeast, a heat wave is typically defined as three consecutive days where the temperature reaches or exceeds 90\\xa0°f (32 2\\xa0°c), but not always as this ties in with humidity levels to determine a heat index threshold the same does not apply to drier climates a heat storm is a californian term for an extended heat wave [citation needed] heat storms occur when the temperature reaches 100\\xa0°f (37 8\\xa0°c) for three or more consecutive days over a wide area (tens of thousands of square miles) [citation needed] the national weather service issues heat advisories and excessive heat warnings when unusual periods of hot weather are expected in adelaide, south australia, a heat wave is defined as five consecutive days at or above 35\\xa0°c (95\\xa0°f), or three consecutive days at or over 40\\xa0°c (104\\xa0°f) the australian bureau of meteorology defines a heat wave as \"three days or more of maximum and minimum temperatures that are unusual for the location\" until the introduction of this new pilot heatwave forecast there was no national definition that described heatwave or measures of heatwave severity in greece, according to the hellenic national metereological service, a heat wave is defined as three consecutive days at or above 39\\xa0°c (102\\xa0°f) and a minimum temperature in the same period at or over 26\\xa0°c (79\\xa0°f), with no winds or with weak winds, and the above conditions being observed in a broad area in the united kingdom, the met office operates a heat health watch system which places each local authority region into one of four levels heatwave conditions are defined by the maximum daytime temperature and minimum nighttime temperature rising above the threshold for a particular region the length of time spent above that threshold determines the particular level level 1 is normal summer conditions level 2 is reached when there is a 60% or higher risk that the temperature will be above the threshold levels for two days and the intervening night level 3 is triggered when the temperature has been above the threshold for the preceding day and night, and there is a 90% or higher chance that it will stay above the threshold in the following day level 4 is triggered if conditions are more severe than those of the preceding three levels each of the first three levels is associated with a particular state of readiness and response by the social and health services, and level 4 is associated with more widespread response a more general indicator that allows comparing heat waves in different regions of the world, characterized by different climates, was published in 2015 this was used to estimate heat waves occurrence at the global scale from 1901 to 2010, finding a substantial and sharp increase in the number of affected areas in the last two decades heat waves form when high pressure aloft (from 10,000–25,000 feet (3,000–7,600 metres)) strengthens and remains over a region for several days up to several weeks this is common in summer (in both northern and southern hemispheres) as the jet stream \\'follows the sun\\' on the equator side of the jet stream, in the upper layers of the atmosphere, is the high pressure area summertime weather patterns are generally slower to change than in winter as a result, this upper level high pressure also moves slowly under high pressure, the air subsides (sinks) toward the surface, warming and drying adiabatically, inhibiting convection and preventing the formation of clouds reduction of clouds increases shortwave radiation reaching the surface a low pressure at the surface leads to surface wind from lower latitudes that brings warm air, enhancing the warming alternatively, the surface winds could blow from the hot continental interior towards the coastal zone, leading to heat waves there, or from a high elevation towards low elevation, enhancing the subsidence and therefore the adiabatic warming in the eastern united states a heat wave can occur when a high pressure system originating in the gulf of mexico becomes stationary just off the atlantic seaboard (typically known as a bermuda high) hot humid air masses form over the gulf of mexico and the caribbean sea while hot dry air masses form over the desert southwest and northern mexico the sw winds on the back side of the high continue to pump hot, humid gulf air northeastward resulting in a spell of hot and humid weather for much of the eastern states in the western cape province of south africa, a heat wave can occur when a low pressure offshore and high pressure inland air combine to form a bergwind the air warms as it descends from the karoo interior, and the temperature will rise about 10\\xa0°c from the interior to the coast humidities are usually very low, and the temperatures can be over 40\\xa0°c in summer the highest official temperatures recorded in south africa (51 5\\xa0°c) was recorded one summer during a bergwind occurring along the eastern cape coastline the role of soil moisture can also contribute to the intensification of heat waves in europe low soil moisture leads to a number of complex feedback mechanisms, which can in turn result in increased surface temperatures one of the main mechanisms is reduced evaporative cooling of the atmosphere when water evaporates, it consumes energy and thus will lower the surrounding temperature if the soil is very dry, then incoming radiation from the sun will warm the air with little or no cooling effect from moisture evaporating from the soil heatwaves over land have become more frequent and more intense since the 1950s due to climate change in almost all world regions furthermore, heat waves are more likely to occur simultaneously with droughts marine heatwaves have also increased in frequency, with a doubling since 1980 the intensity of individual heat waves can often be attributed to global warming some extreme events would have been nearly impossible without human influence on the climate system a heatwave that would occur once every ten years before global warming started, now occurs 2 8 times as often under further warming, heatwaves are set to become more frequent an event that would occur each ten year, would occur every other year if global warming reaches 2\\xa0°c heat waves and droughts as a result, minimize ecosystem carbon uptake carbon uptake is also known as carbon sequestration extreme heat wave events are predicted to happen with increased global warming, which puts stress on ecosystems stress on ecosystems due to future intensified heat waves will reduce biological productivity this will cause changes in the ecosystem\\'s carbon cycle feedback because there will be less vegetation to hold the carbon from the atmosphere, which will only contribute more to atmospheric warming policy makers, funders and researchers responding to the increasing heatwaves created the extreme heat resilience alliance coalition under the atlantic council to advocate for naming heatwaves, measuring them, and ranking them to build better awareness of their impacts june 2019 was the hottest month on record worldwide, the effects of this were especially prominent in europe increased wildfires in places such as spain can also be attributed to heat waves in july 2019, over 50 million people in the united states were present in a jurisdiction with any type of heat advisory scientists predicted that in the days following the issuance of these warnings, many records for highest low temperatures will be broken: i e the lowest temperature in a 24-hour period will be higher than any low temperature measured before the 2021 western north america heat wave resulted in some of the highest temperatures ever recorded in the region, including 49 6\\xa0°c (121 3\\xa0°f), the highest temperature ever measured in canada a study that investigated 13,115 cities found that extreme heat exposure of a wet bulb globe temperature above 30\\xa0°c tripled between 1983 and 2016 it increased by ~50% when the population growth in these cities is not taken into account urban areas and living spaces are often significantly warmer than surrounding rural areas, partly due to the urban heat island effect the researchers compiled a comprehensive inventory of past urban extreme heat events the heat index (as shown in the table above) is a measure of how hot it feels when relative humidity is factored with the actual air temperature hyperthermia, also known as heat stroke, becomes commonplace during periods of sustained high temperature and humidity older adults, very young children, and those who are sick or overweight are at a higher risk for heat-related illness the chronically ill and elderly are often taking prescription medications (e g , diuretics, anticholinergics, antipsychotics, and antihypertensives) that interfere with the body\\'s ability to dissipate heat heat edema presents as a transient swelling of the hands, feet, and ankles and is generally secondary to increased aldosterone secretion, which enhances water retention when combined with peripheral vasodilation and venous stasis, the excess fluid accumulates in the dependent areas of the extremities the heat edema usually resolves within several days after the patient becomes acclimated to the warmer environment no treatment is required, although wearing support stockings and elevating the affected legs will help minimize the edema heat rash, also known as prickly heat, is a maculopapular rash accompanied by acute inflammation and blocked sweat ducts the sweat ducts may become dilated and may eventually rupture, producing small pruritic vesicles on an erythematous base heat rash affects areas of the body covered by tight clothing if this continues for a duration of time it can lead to the development of chronic dermatitis or a secondary bacterial infection prevention is the best therapy it is also advised to wear loose-fitting clothing in the heat however, once heat rash has developed, the initial treatment involves the application of chlorhexidine lotion to remove any desquamated skin the associated itching may be treated with topical or systemic antihistamines if infection occurs a regimen of antibiotics is required heat cramps are painful, often severe, involuntary spasms of the large muscle groups used in strenuous exercise heat cramps tend to occur after intense exertion they usually develop in people performing heavy exercise while sweating profusely and replenishing fluid loss with non-electrolyte containing water this is believed to lead to hyponatremia that induces cramping in stressed muscles rehydration with salt-containing fluids provides rapid relief patients with mild cramps can be given oral  2% salt solutions, while those with severe cramps require iv isotonic fluids the many sport drinks on the market are a good source of electrolytes and are readily accessible heat syncope is related to heat exposure that produces orthostatic hypotension this hypotension can precipitate a near-syncopal episode heat syncope is believed to result from intense sweating, which leads to dehydration, followed by peripheral vasodilation and reduced venous blood return in the face of decreased vasomotor control management of heat syncope consists of cooling and rehydration of the patient using oral rehydration therapy (sport drinks) or isotonic iv fluids people who experience heat syncope should avoid standing in the heat for long periods of time they should move to a cooler environment and lie down if they recognize the initial symptoms wearing support stockings and engaging in deep knee-bending movements can help promote venous blood return heat exhaustion is considered by experts to be the forerunner of heat stroke (hyperthermia) it may even resemble heat stroke, with the difference being that the neurologic function remains intact heat exhaustion is marked by excessive dehydration and electrolyte depletion symptoms may include diarrhea, headache, nausea and vomiting, dizziness, tachycardia, malaise, and myalgia definitive therapy includes removing patients from the heat and replenishing their fluids most patients will require fluid replacement with iv isotonic fluids at first the salt content is adjusted as necessary once the electrolyte levels are known after discharge from the hospital, patients are instructed to rest, drink plenty of fluids for 2–3 hours, and avoid the heat for several days if this advice is not followed it may then lead to heat stroke one public health measure taken during heat waves is the setting-up of air-conditioned public cooling centers heat waves are the most lethal type of weather phenomenon in the united states between 1992 and 2001, deaths from excessive heat in the united states numbered 2,190, compared with 880 deaths from floods and 150 from hurricanes the average annual number of fatalities directly attributed to heat in the united states is about 400 the 1995 chicago heat wave, one of the worst in us history, led to approximately 739 heat-related deaths over a period of 5 days eric klinenberg has noted that in the united states, the loss of human life in hot spells in summer exceeds that caused by all other weather events combined, including lightning, rain, floods, hurricanes, and tornadoes despite the dangers, scott sheridan, professor of geography at kent state university, found that less than half of people 65 and older abide by heat-emergency recommendations such as drinking plenty of water in his study of heat-wave behavior, focusing particularly on seniors in philadelphia, phoenix, toronto, and dayton, ohio, he found that people over 65 \"don\\'t consider themselves seniors \" one of his older respondents said: \"heat doesn\\'t bother me much, but i worry about my neighbors \"according to the agency for health care research and quality, about 6,200 americans are hospitalized each summer due to excessive heat, and those at highest risk are poor, uninsured or elderly more than 70,000 europeans died as a result of the 2003 european heat wave also more than 2,000 people died in karachi, pakistan in june 2015 due to a severe heat wave with temperatures as high as 49\\xa0°c (120\\xa0°f) the concern now is focusing on predicting the future likelihood of heat waves and their severity additionally, due to the fact that in most of the world, most of those suffering the impacts of a heat wave will be inside a building this will modify the temperatures they are exposed to, and as a result, there is the need to link climate models to building models this means producing example time series of future weather other work has shown that future mortality due to heat waves could be reduced if buildings were better designed to modify the internal climate, or if the occupants were better educated about the issues, so they can take action in time the number of heat fatalities is likely highly underreported due to a lack of reports and misreports part of the mortality observed during a heat wave, however, can be attributed to a so-called \"harvesting effect\", a term for a short-term forward mortality displacement it has been observed that for some heat waves, there is a compensatory decrease in overall mortality during the subsequent weeks after a heat wave such compensatory reductions in mortality suggest that heat affects especially those so ill that they \"would have died in the short term anyway\" another explanation for underreporting is the social attenuation in most contexts of heat waves as a health risk as shown by the deadly french heat wave in 2003, heat wave dangers result from the intricate association of natural and social factors in addition to physical stress, excessive heat causes psychological stress, to a degree which affects performance, and is also associated with an increase in violent crime high temperatures are associated with increased conflict both at the interpersonal level and at the societal level in every society, crime rates go up when temperatures go up, particularly violent crimes such as assault, murder, and rape furthermore, in politically unstable countries, high temperatures are an aggravating factor that lead toward civil wars additionally, high temperatures have a significant effect on income a study of counties in the united states found that economic productivity of individual days declines by about 1 7% for each degree celsius above 15\\xa0°c (59\\xa0°f) ozone pollution in urban areas is especially concerning with increasing temperatures, raising heat-related mortality during heat waves during heat waves in urban areas, ground level ozone pollution can be 20% higher than usual one study concluded that from 1860 to 2000, the global population-weighted fine particle concentrations increased by 5% and near-surface ozone concentrations by 2% due to climate change an investigation to assess the joint mortality effects of ozone and heat during the european heat waves in 2003, concluded that these appear to be additive heat waves significantly threaten agricultural production in 2019, heat waves in the mulanje region of malawi experienced temperatures as high as 40\\xa0°c (104\\xa0°f) heat waves and a late rain season resulted in significant leaf scorching of tea leaves in malawi, leading to reduced yields if a heat wave occurs during a drought, which dries out vegetation, it can contribute to bushfires and wildfires during the disastrous heat wave that struck europe in 2003, fires raged through portugal, destroying over 3,010 square kilometres (1,160\\xa0sq\\xa0mi) or 301,000 hectares (740,000 acres) of forest and 440 square kilometres (170\\xa0sq\\xa0mi) or 44,000 hectares (110,000 acres) of agricultural land and causing an estimated €1\\xa0billion worth of damage high end farmlands have irrigation systems to back up crops with heat waves cause wildfires heat waves can and do cause roads and highways to buckle and melt, water lines to burst, and power transformers to detonate, causing fires heat waves can also damage rail roads, such as buckling and kinking rails, which can lead to slower traffic, delays, and even cancellations of service when rails are too dangerous to traverse by trains heat waves often lead to electricity spikes due to increased air conditioning use, which can create power outages, exacerbating the problem during the 2006 north american heat wave, thousands of homes and businesses went without power, especially in california in los angeles, electrical transformers failed, leaving thousands without power for as long as five days the 2009 south eastern australia heat wave caused the city of melbourne, australia to experience some major power disruptions which left over half a million people without power as the heat wave blew transformers and overloaded a power grid categoriesa wildfire, forest fire, bushfire, wildland fire or rural fire is an unplanned, uncontrolled and unpredictable fire in an area of combustible vegetation starting in rural and urban areas some forest ecosystems in their natural state depend on wildfire depending on the type of vegetation present, a wildfire can also be classified more specifically as a bushfire (in australia), desert fire, grass fire, hill fire, peat fire, prairie fire, vegetation fire, or veld fire wildfires are distinct from beneficial uses of fire, called controlled burns, though controlled burns can turn into wildfires fossil charcoal indicates that wildfires began soon after the appearance of terrestrial plants approximately 419 million years ago during the silurian period the occurrence of wildfires throughout the history of terrestrial life invites conjecture that fire must have had pronounced evolutionary effects on most ecosystems\\' flora and fauna earth\\'s carbon-rich vegetation, seasonally dry climates, atmospheric oxygen, and widespread lightning and volcanic ignitions create good conditions for fires wildfires are often classified by characteristics like cause of ignition, physical properties, combustible material present, and the effect of weather on the fire wildfire behavior and severity result from a combination of factors such as available fuels, physical setting, and weather climatic cycles that include wet periods that create substantial fuels and then are followed by drought and heat often proceed severe wildfires these cycles are made worse by heat waves and droughts caused by climate change wildfires can cause damage to property and human life, although naturally occurring wildfires may have beneficial effects on native vegetation, animals, and ecosystems that have evolved with fire high-severity wildfire creates complex early seral forest habitat (also called \"snag forest habitat\"), which often has higher species richness and diversity than an unburned old forest many plant species depend on the effects of fire for growth and reproduction wildfires in ecosystems where wildfire is uncommon or where non-native vegetation has encroached may have strongly negative ecological effects similarly, human societies can be severely impacted by fires, including direct health impacts of smoke, destruction of property, especially in wildland–urban interfaces, economic and ecosystem services losses, and contamination of water and soil wildfires are among the most common forms of natural disaster in some regions, including siberia, california, and australia areas with mediterranean climates or in the taiga biome are particularly susceptible at a global level, human practices have made wildfires worse than naturally would happen, with a doubling in land area burned by wildfires when compared to natural levels humans have contributed to major factors to increased wildfires, increased heat and dry periods due to climate change and other more direct human activities, such as land-use change and wildfire suppression this increase in fires, creates a negative feedback loop releasing naturally sequestered carbon back into the atmosphere, creating further global warming modern forest management taking an ecological perspective engages in controlled burns to mitigate this risk and promote natural forest life cycles  mw-parser-output  toclimit-2

latitudes, the most common human causes of wildfires are equipment generating sparks (chainsaws, grinders, mowers, etc ), overhead power lines, and arson in the tropics, farmers often practice the slash-and-burn method of clearing fields during the dry season when thousands of farmers do this simultaneously, much of a continent can appear from orbit to be one vast blaze coal seam fires burn in the thousands around the world, such as those in burning mountain, new south wales; centralia, pennsylvania; and several coal-sustained fires in china they can also flare up unexpectedly and ignite nearby flammable material the spread of wildfires varies based on the flammable material present, its vertical arrangement and moisture content, and weather conditions fuel arrangement and density is governed in part by topography, as land shape determines factors such as available sunlight and water for plant growth overall, fire types can be generally characterized by their fuels as follows:in monsoonal areas of north australia, surface fires can spread, including across intended firebreaks, by burning or smoldering pieces of wood or burning tufts of grass carried intentionally by large flying birds accustomed to catch prey flushed out by wildfires species involved in this activity are the black kite (milvus migrans), whistling kite (haliastur sphenurus), and brown falcon (falco berigora) local aborigines have known of this behavior for a long time, including in their mythology wildfires occur when all the necessary elements of a fire triforce come together in a susceptible area: an ignition source is brought into contact with a combustible material such as vegetation that is subjected to enough heat and has an adequate supply of oxygen from the ambient air a high moisture content usually prevents ignition and slows propagation, because higher temperatures are needed to evaporate any water in the material and heat the material to its fire point dense forests usually provide more shade, resulting in lower ambient temperatures and greater humidity, and are therefore less susceptible to wildfires less dense material such as grasses and leaves are easier to ignite because they contain less water than denser material such as branches and trunks plants continuously lose water by evapotranspiration, but water loss is usually balanced by water absorbed from the soil, humidity, or rain when this balance is not maintained, plants dry out and are therefore more flammable, often as a consequence of droughts a wildfire front is the portion sustaining continuous flaming combustion, where unburned material meets active flames, or the smoldering transition between unburned and burned material as the front approaches, the fire heats both the surrounding air and woody material through convection and thermal radiation first, wood is dried as water is vaporized at a temperature of 100\\xa0°c (212\\xa0°f) next, the pyrolysis of wood at 230\\xa0°c (450\\xa0°f) releases flammable gases finally, wood can smolder at 380\\xa0°c (720\\xa0°f) or, when heated sufficiently, ignite at 590\\xa0°c (1,000\\xa0°f) even before the flames of a wildfire arrive at a particular location, heat transfer from the wildfire front warms the air to 800\\xa0°c (1,470\\xa0°f), which pre-heats and dries flammable materials, causing materials to ignite faster and allowing the fire to spread faster high-temperature and long-duration surface wildfires may encourage flashover or torching: the drying of tree canopies and their subsequent ignition from below wildfires have a rapid forward rate of spread (fros) when burning through dense uninterrupted fuels they can move as fast as 10 8 kilometres per hour (6 7\\xa0mph) in forests and 22 kilometres per hour (14\\xa0mph) in grasslands wildfires can advance tangential to the main front to form a flanking front, or burn in the opposite direction of the main front by backing they may also spread by jumping or spotting as winds and vertical convection columns carry firebrands (hot wood embers) and other burning materials through the air over roads, rivers, and other barriers that may otherwise act as firebreaks torching and fires in tree canopies encourage spotting, and dry ground fuels around a wildfire are especially vulnerable to ignition from firebrands spotting can create spot fires as hot embers and firebrands ignite fuels downwind from the fire in australian bushfires, spot fires are known to occur as far as 20 kilometres (12\\xa0mi) from the fire front the incidence of large, uncontained wildfires in north america has increased in recent years, significantly impacting both urban and agriculturally-focused areas the physical damage and health pressures left in the wake of uncontrolled fires has especially devastated farm and ranch operators in affected areas, prompting concern from the community of healthcare providers and advocates servicing this specialized occupational population especially large wildfires may affect air currents in their immediate vicinities by the stack effect: air rises as it is heated, and large wildfires create powerful updrafts that will draw in new, cooler air from surrounding areas in thermal columns great vertical differences in temperature and humidity encourage pyrocumulus clouds, strong winds, and fire whirls with the force of tornadoes at speeds of more than 80 kilometres per hour (50\\xa0mph) rapid rates of spread, prolific crowning or spotting, the presence of fire whirls, and strong convection columns signify extreme conditions the thermal heat from a wildfire can cause significant weathering of rocks and boulders heat can rapidly expand a boulder and thermal shock can occur, which may cause an object\\'s structure to fail heat waves, droughts, climate variability such as el niño, and regional weather patterns such as high-pressure ridges can increase the risk and alter the behavior of wildfires dramatically years of precipitation followed by warm periods can encourage more widespread fires and longer fire seasons temperature affects wildfires in the same way, they dry out the load and make them more flammable since the mid-1980s, earlier snowmelt and associated warming has also been associated with an increase in length and severity of the wildfire season, or the most fire-prone time of the year, in the western united states global warming may increase the intensity and frequency of droughts in many areas, creating more intense and frequent wildfires a 2019 study indicates that the increase in fire risk in california may be attributable to human-induced climate change a study of alluvial sediment deposits going back over 8,000 years found warmer climate periods experienced severe droughts and stand-replacing fires and concluded climate was such a powerful influence on wildfire that trying to recreate presettlement forest structure is likely impossible in a warmer future intensity also increases during daytime hours burn rates of smoldering logs are up to five times greater during the day due to lower humidity, increased temperatures, and increased wind speeds sunlight warms the ground during the day which creates air currents that travel uphill at night the land cools, creating air currents that travel downhill wildfires are fanned by these winds and often follow the air currents over hills and through valleys fires in europe occur frequently during the hours of 12:00\\xa0p m and 2:00\\xa0p m wildfire suppression operations in the united states revolve around a 24-hour fire day that begins at 10:00\\xa0a m due to the predictable increase in intensity resulting from the daytime warmth in the summer of 1974–1975 (southern hemisphere), australia suffered its worst recorded wildfire, when 15% of australia\\'s land mass suffered \"extensive fire damage\" fires that summer burned up an estimated 117\\xa0million hectares (290\\xa0million acres; 1,170,000 square kilometres; 450,000 square miles) in australia, the annual number of hot days (above 35\\xa0°c) and very hot days (above 40\\xa0°c) has increased significantly in many areas of the country since 1950 the country has always had bushfires but in 2019, the extent and ferocity of these fires increased dramatically for the first time catastrophic bushfire conditions were declared for greater sydney new south wales and queensland declared a state of emergency but fires were also burning in south australia and western australia in 2019, extreme heat and dryness caused massive wildfires in siberia, alaska, canary islands, australia, and in the amazon rainforest the fires in the latter were caused mainly by illegal logging the smoke from the fires expanded on huge territory including major cities, dramatically reducing air quality as of august 2020, the wildfires in that year were 13% worse than in 2019 due primarily to climate change and deforestation the amazon rainforest\\'s existence is threatened by fires according to mike barrett, executive director of science and conservation at wwf-uk, if this rainforest is destroyed \"we lose the fight against climate change there will be no going back ” record-breaking wildfires in 2021 occurred in turkey, greece, california and russia, thought to be linked to climate change wildfires release large amounts of carbon dioxide, black and brown carbon particles, and ozone precursors such as volatile organic compounds and nitrogen oxides (nox) into the atmosphere these emissions affect radiation, clouds, and climate on regional and even global scales wildfires also emit substantial amounts of semi-volatile organic species that can partition from the gas phase to form secondary organic aerosol (soa) over hours to days after emission in addition, the formation of the other pollutants as the air is transported can lead to harmful exposures for populations in regions far away from the wildfires while direct emissions of harmful pollutants can affect first responders and local residents, wildfire smoke can also be transported over long distances and impact air quality across local, regional, and global scales whether transported smoke plumes are relevant for surface air quality depends on where they exist in the atmosphere, which in turn depends on the initial injection height of the convective smoke plume into the atmosphere smoke that is injected above the planetary boundary layer (pbl) may be detectable from spaceborne satellites and play a role in altering the earth\\'s energy budget, but would not mix down to the surface where it would impact air quality and human health alternatively, smoke confined to a shallow pbl (through nighttime stable stratification of the atmosphere or terrain trapping) may become particularly concentrated and problematic for surface air quality wildfire intensity and smoke emissions are not constant throughout the fire lifetime and tend to follow a diurnal cycle that peaks in late afternoon and early evening, and which may be reasonably approximated using a monomodal or bimodal normal distribution over the past century, wildfires have accounted for 20-25% of global carbon emissions, the remainder from human activities global carbon emissions from wildfires through august 2020 equaled the average annual emissions of the european union in 2020, the carbon released by california\\'s wildfires were significantly larger than the state\\'s other carbon emissions wildfire\\'s occurrence throughout the history of terrestrial life invites conjecture that fire must have had pronounced evolutionary effects on most ecosystems\\' flora and fauna wildfires are common in climates that are sufficiently moist to allow the growth of vegetation but feature extended dry, hot periods such places include the vegetated areas of australia and southeast asia, the veld in southern africa, the fynbos in the western cape of south africa, the forested areas of the united states and canada, and the mediterranean basin high-severity wildfire creates complex early seral forest habitat (also called “snag forest habitat”), which often has higher species richness and diversity than unburned old forest plant and animal species in most types of north american forests evolved with fire, and many of these species depend on wildfires, and particularly high-severity fires, to reproduce and grow fire helps to return nutrients from plant matter back to soil, the heat from fire is necessary to the germination of certain types of seeds, and the snags (dead trees) and early successional forests created by high-severity fire create habitat conditions that are beneficial to wildlife early successional forests created by high-severity fire support some of the highest levels of native biodiversity found in temperate conifer forests post-fire logging has no ecological benefits and many negative impacts; the same is often true for post-fire seeding although some ecosystems rely on naturally occurring fires to regulate growth, some ecosystems suffer from too much fire, such as the chaparral in southern california and lower-elevation deserts in the american southwest the increased fire frequency in these ordinarily fire-dependent areas has upset natural cycles, damaged native plant communities, and encouraged the growth of non-native weeds invasive species, such as lygodium microphyllum and bromus tectorum, can grow rapidly in areas that were damaged by fires because they are highly flammable, they can increase the future risk of fire, creating a positive feedback loop that increases fire frequency and further alters native vegetation communities in the amazon rainforest, drought, logging, cattle ranching practices, and slash-and-burn agriculture damage fire-resistant forests and promote the growth of flammable brush, creating a cycle that encourages more burning fires in the rainforest threaten its collection of diverse species and produce large amounts of co2 also, fires in the rainforest, along with drought and human involvement, could damage or destroy more than half of the amazon rainforest by 2030 wildfires generate ash, reduce the availability of organic nutrients, and cause an increase in water runoff, eroding away other nutrients and creating flash flood conditions a 2003 wildfire in the north yorkshire moors burned off 2 5 square kilometers (600 acres) of heather and the underlying peat layers afterwards, wind erosion stripped the ash and the exposed soil, revealing archaeological remains dating back to 10,000\\xa0bc wildfires can also have an effect on climate change, increasing the amount of carbon released into the atmosphere and inhibiting vegetation growth, which affects overall carbon uptake by plants in tundra there is a natural pattern of accumulation of fuel and wildfire which varies depending on the nature of vegetation and terrain research in alaska has shown fire-event return intervals, (fris) that typically vary from 150 to 200 years with dryer lowland areas burning more frequently than wetter upland areas plants in wildfire-prone ecosystems often survive through adaptations to their local fire regime such adaptations include physical protection against heat, increased growth after a fire event, and flammable materials that encourage fire and may eliminate competition for example, plants of the genus eucalyptus contain flammable oils that encourage fire and hard sclerophyll leaves to resist heat and drought, ensuring their dominance over less fire-tolerant species dense bark, shedding lower branches, and high water content in external structures may also protect trees from rising temperatures fire-resistant seeds and reserve shoots that sprout after a fire encourage species preservation, as embodied by pioneer species smoke, charred wood, and heat can stimulate the germination of seeds in a process called serotiny exposure to smoke from burning plants promotes germination in other types of plants by inducing the production of the orange butenolide grasslands in western sabah, malaysian pine forests, and indonesian casuarina forests are believed to have resulted from previous periods of fire chamise deadwood litter is low in water content and flammable, and the shrub quickly sprouts after a fire cape lilies lie dormant until flames brush away the covering and then blossom almost overnight sequoia rely on periodic fires to reduce competition, release seeds from their cones, and clear the soil and canopy for new growth caribbean pine in bahamian pineyards have adapted to and rely on low-intensity, surface fires for survival and growth an optimum fire frequency for growth is every 3 to 10 years too frequent fires favor herbaceous plants, and infrequent fires favor species typical of bahamian dry forests most of the earth\\'s weather and air pollution resides in the troposphere, the part of the atmosphere that extends from the surface of the planet to a height of about 10 kilometers (6\\xa0mi) the vertical lift of a severe thunderstorm or pyrocumulonimbus can be enhanced in the area of a large wildfire, which can propel smoke, soot, and other particulate matter as high as the lower stratosphere previously, prevailing scientific theory held that most particles in the stratosphere came from volcanoes, but smoke and other wildfire emissions have been detected from the lower stratosphere pyrocumulus clouds can reach 6,100 meters (20,000\\xa0ft) over wildfires satellite observation of smoke plumes from wildfires revealed that the plumes could be traced intact for distances exceeding 1,600 kilometers (1,000\\xa0mi) computer-aided models such as calpuff may help predict the size and direction of wildfire-generated smoke plumes by using atmospheric dispersion modeling wildfires can affect local atmospheric pollution, and release carbon in the form of carbon dioxide wildfire emissions contain fine particulate matter which can cause cardiovascular and respiratory problems increased fire byproducts in the troposphere can increase ozone concentration beyond safe levels forest fires in indonesia in 1997 were estimated to have released between 0 81 and 2 57 gigatonnes (0 89 and 2 83 billion short tons) of co2 into the atmosphere, which is between 13%–40% of the annual global carbon dioxide emissions from burning fossil fuels in june and july of 2019, fires in the arctic emitted more than 140 megatons of carbon dioxide, according to an analysis by cams to put that into perspective this amounts to the same amount of carbon emitted by 36 million cars in a year the recent wildfires and their massive co2 emissions mean that it will be important to take them into consideration when implementing measures for reaching greenhouse gas reduction targets accorded with the paris climate agreement due to the complex oxidative chemistry occurring during the transport of wildfire smoke in the atmosphere, the toxicity of emissions was indicated to increase over time atmospheric models suggest that these concentrations of sooty particles could increase absorption of incoming solar radiation during winter months by as much as 15% the amazon is estimated to hold around 90 billion tons of carbon as of 2019, earth\\'s atmosphere has 415 parts per million of carbon, and the destruction of the amazon would add about 38 parts per million wildfire prevention refers to the preemptive methods aimed at reducing the risk of fires as well as lessening its severity and spread prevention techniques aim to manage air quality, maintain ecological balances, protect resources, and to affect future fires north american firefighting policies permit naturally caused fires to burn to maintain their ecological role, so long as the risks of escape into high-value areas are mitigated however, prevention policies must consider the role that humans play in wildfires, since, for example, 95% of forest fires in europe are related to human involvement sources of human-caused fire may include arson, accidental ignition, or the uncontrolled use of fire in land-clearing and agriculture such as the slash-and-burn farming in southeast asia in 1937, u s president franklin d roosevelt initiated a nationwide fire prevention campaign, highlighting the role of human carelessness in forest fires later posters of the program featured uncle sam, characters from the disney movie bambi, and the official mascot of the u s forest service, smokey bear reducing human-caused ignitions may be the most effective means of reducing unwanted wildfire alteration of fuels is commonly undertaken when attempting to affect future fire risk and behavior wildfire prevention programs around the world may employ techniques such as wildland fire use (wfu) and prescribed or controlled burns wildland fire use refers to any fire of natural causes that is monitored but allowed to burn controlled burns are fires ignited by government agencies under less dangerous weather conditions according to the united states fish and wildlife service, in rugged, steep, or highly inaccessible terrain where people are not threatened, wildland fire use can help avoid putting firefighters at unreasonable risk other objectives can include maintenance of healthy forests, rangelands, and wetlands, and support of ecosystem diversity strategies for wildfire prevention, detection, control and suppression have varied over the years one common and inexpensive technique to reduce the risk of uncontrolled wildfires is controlled burning: intentionally igniting smaller less-intense fires to minimize the amount of flammable material available for a potential wildfire vegetation may be burned periodically to limit the accumulation of plants and other debris that may serve as fuel, while also maintaining high species diversity jan van wagtendonk, a biologist at the yellowstone field station, claims that wildfire itself is \"the most effective treatment for reducing a fire\\'s rate of spread, fireline intensity, flame length, and heat per unit of area \" while other people claim that controlled burns and a policy of allowing some wildfires to burn is the cheapest method and an ecologically appropriate policy for many forests, they tend not to take into account the economic value of resources that are consumed by the fire, especially merchantable timber some studies conclude that while fuels may also be removed by logging, such thinning treatments may not be effective at reducing fire severity under extreme weather conditions however, multi-agency studies conducted by the united states department of agriculture, the u s forest service pacific northwest research station, and the school of forestry and bureau of business and economic research at the university of montana, through strategic assessments of fire hazards and the potential effectiveness and costs of different hazard reduction treatments, clearly demonstrate that the most effective short- and long-term forest fire hazard reduction strategy and by far the most cost-effective method to yield long-term mitigation of forest fire risk is a comprehensive fuel reduction strategy that involves mechanical removal of overstocked trees through commercial logging and non-commercial thinning with no restrictions on the size of trees that are removed, resulting in considerably better long-term results compared to a non-commercial \"thin below\" operation or a commercial logging operation with diameter restrictions starting with a forest with a \"high risk\" of fire and a pre-treatment crowning index of 21, the \"thin from below\" practice of removing only very small trees resulted in an immediate crowning index of 43, with 29% of the post-treatment area rated \"low risk\" immediately and only 20% of the treatment area remaining \"low risk\" after 30 years, at a cost (net economic loss) of $439 per acre treated again starting with a forest at \"high risk\" of fire and a crowning index of 21, the strategy involving non-commercial thinning and commercial logging with size-restrictions resulted in an crowning index of 43 immediately post-treatment with 67% of the area considered \"low risk\" and 56% of the area remaining low risk after 30 years, at a cost (net economic loss) of $368 per acre treated on the other hand, starting with a forest at \"high risk\" of fire and the same crowning index of 21, a comprehensive fire hazard reduction treatment strategy, without restrictions on size of trees removed, resulted in an immediate crowning index of 61 post-treatment with 69% of the treated area rated \"low risk\" immediately and 52% of the treated area remaining \"low risk\" after 30 years, with positive revenue (a net economic gain gain) of $8 per acre building codes in fire-prone areas typically require that structures be built of flame-resistant materials and a defensible space be maintained by clearing flammable materials within a prescribed distance from the structure communities in the philippines also maintain fire lines 5 to 10 meters (16 to 33\\xa0ft) wide between the forest and their village, and patrol these lines during summer months or seasons of dry weather continued residential development in fire-prone areas and rebuilding structures destroyed by fires has been met with criticism the ecological benefits of fire are often overridden by the economic and safety benefits of protecting structures and human life fast and effective detection is a key factor in wildfire fighting early detection efforts were focused on early response, accurate results in both daytime and nighttime, and the ability to prioritize fire danger fire lookout towers were used in the united states in the early 20th century and fires were reported using telephones, carrier pigeons, and heliographs aerial and land photography using instant cameras were used in the 1950s until infrared scanning was developed for fire detection in the 1960s however, information analysis and delivery was often delayed by limitations in communication technology early satellite-derived fire analyses were hand-drawn on maps at a remote site and sent via overnight mail to the fire manager during the yellowstone fires of 1988, a data station was established in west yellowstone, permitting the delivery of satellite-based fire information in approximately four hours currently, public hotlines, fire lookouts in towers, and ground and aerial patrols can be used as a means of early detection of forest fires however, accurate human observation may be limited by operator fatigue, time of day, time of year, and geographic location electronic systems have gained popularity in recent years as a possible resolution to human operator error a government report on a recent trial of three automated camera fire detection systems in australia did, however, conclude \"   detection by the camera systems was slower and less reliable than by a trained human observer\" these systems may be semi- or fully automated and employ systems based on the risk area and degree of human presence, as suggested by gis data analyses an integrated approach of multiple systems can be used to merge satellite data, aerial imagery, and personnel position via global positioning system (gps) into a collective whole for near-realtime use by wireless incident command centers a small, high risk area that features thick vegetation, a strong human presence, or is close to a critical urban area can be monitored using a local sensor network detection systems may include wireless sensor networks that act as automated weather systems: detecting temperature, humidity, and smoke these may be battery-powered, solar-powered, or tree-rechargeable: able to recharge their battery systems using the small electrical currents in plant material larger, medium-risk areas can be monitored by scanning towers that incorporate fixed cameras and sensors to detect smoke or additional factors such as the infrared signature of carbon dioxide produced by fires additional capabilities such as night vision, brightness detection, and color change detection may also be incorporated into sensor arrays satellite and aerial monitoring through the use of planes, helicopter, or uavs can provide a wider view and may be sufficient to monitor very large, low risk areas these more sophisticated systems employ gps and aircraft-mounted infrared or high-resolution visible cameras to identify and target wildfires satellite-mounted sensors such as envisat\\'s advanced along track scanning radiometer and european remote-sensing satellite\\'s along-track scanning radiometer can measure infrared radiation emitted by fires, identifying hot spots greater than 39\\xa0°c (102\\xa0°f) the national oceanic and atmospheric administration\\'s hazard mapping system combines remote-sensing data from satellite sources such as geostationary operational environmental satellite (goes), moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (modis), and advanced very high resolution radiometer (avhrr) for detection of fire and smoke plume locations however, satellite detection is prone to offset errors, anywhere from 2 to 3 kilometers (1 to 2\\xa0mi) for modis and avhrr data and up to 12 kilometers (7 5\\xa0mi) for goes data satellites in geostationary orbits may become disabled, and satellites in polar orbits are often limited by their short window of observation time cloud cover and image resolution may also limit the effectiveness of satellite imagery global forest watch provides detailed daily updates on fire alerts these are sourced from nasa firms “viirs active fires ”in 2015 a new fire detection tool is in operation at the u s department of agriculture (usda) forest service (usfs) which uses data from the suomi national polar-orbiting partnership (npp) satellite to detect smaller fires in more detail than previous space-based products the high-resolution data is used with a computer model to predict how a fire will change direction based on weather and land conditions the active fire detection product using data from suomi npp\\'s visible infrared imaging radiometer suite (viirs) increases the resolution of fire observations to 1,230 feet (375 meters) previous nasa satellite data products available since the early 2000s observed fires at 3,280 foot (1 kilometer) resolution the data is one of the intelligence tools used by the usfs and department of interior agencies across the united states to guide resource allocation and strategic fire management decisions the enhanced viirs fire product enables detection every 12 hours or less of much smaller fires and provides more detail and consistent tracking of fire lines during long-duration wildfires – capabilities critical for early warning systems and support of routine mapping of fire progression active fire locations are available to users within minutes from the satellite overpass through data processing facilities at the usfs remote sensing applications center, which uses technologies developed by the nasa goddard space flight center direct readout laboratory in greenbelt, maryland the model uses data on weather conditions and the land surrounding an active fire to predict 12–18 hours in advance whether a blaze will shift direction the state of colorado decided to incorporate the weather-fire model in its firefighting efforts beginning with the 2016 fire season in 2014, an international campaign was organized in south africa\\'s kruger national park to validate fire detection products including the new viirs active fire data in advance of that campaign, the meraka institute of the council for scientific and industrial research in pretoria, south africa, an early adopter of the viirs 375\\xa0m fire product, put it to use during several large wildfires in kruger the demand for timely, high-quality fire information has increased in recent years wildfires in the united states burn an average of 7 million acres of land each year for the last 10 years, the usfs and department of interior have spent a combined average of about $2–4 billion annually on wildfire suppression wildfire suppression depends on the technologies available in the area in which the wildfire occurs in less developed nations the techniques used can be as simple as throwing sand or beating the fire with sticks or palm fronds in more advanced nations, the suppression methods vary due to increased technological capacity silver iodide can be used to encourage snow fall, while fire retardants and water can be dropped onto fires by unmanned aerial vehicles, planes, and helicopters complete fire suppression is no longer an expectation, but the majority of wildfires are often extinguished before they grow out of control while more than 99% of the 10,000 new wildfires each year are contained, escaped wildfires under extreme weather conditions are difficult to suppress without a change in the weather wildfires in canada and the us burn an average of 54,500 square kilometers (13,000,000 acres) per year above all, fighting wildfires can become deadly a wildfire\\'s burning front may also change direction unexpectedly and jump across fire breaks intense heat and smoke can lead to disorientation and loss of appreciation of the direction of the fire, which can make fires particularly dangerous for example, during the 1949 mann gulch fire in montana, united states, thirteen smokejumpers died when they lost their communication links, became disoriented, and were overtaken by the fire in the australian february 2009 victorian bushfires, at least 173 people died and over 2,029 homes and 3,500 structures were lost when they became engulfed by wildfire the suppression of wild fires takes up a large amount of a country\\'s gross domestic product which directly affects the country\\'s economy while costs vary wildly from year to year, depending on the severity of each fire season, in the united states, local, state, federal and tribal agencies collectively spend tens of billions of dollars annually to suppress wildfires in the united states, it was reported that approximately $6 billion was spent between 2004–2008 to suppress wildfires in the country in california, the u s forest service spends about $200 million per year to suppress 98% of wildfires and up to $1 billion to suppress the other 2% of fires that escape initial attack and become large wildland fire fighters face several life-threatening hazards including heat stress, fatigue, smoke and dust, as well as the risk of other injuries such as burns, cuts and scrapes, animal bites, and even rhabdomyolysis between 2000–2016, more than 350\\xa0wildland firefighters died on-duty especially in hot weather conditions, fires present the risk of heat stress, which can entail feeling heat, fatigue, weakness, vertigo, headache, or nausea heat stress can progress into heat strain, which entails physiological changes such as increased heart rate and core body temperature this can lead to heat-related illnesses, such as heat rash, cramps, exhaustion or heat stroke various factors can contribute to the risks posed by heat stress, including strenuous work, personal risk factors such as age and fitness, dehydration, sleep deprivation, and burdensome personal protective equipment rest, cool water, and occasional breaks are crucial to mitigating the effects of heat stress smoke, ash, and debris can also pose serious respiratory hazards to wildland firefighters the smoke and dust from wildfires can contain gases such as carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide and formaldehyde, as well as particulates such as ash and silica to reduce smoke exposure, wildfire fighting crews should, whenever possible, rotate firefighters through areas of heavy smoke, avoid downwind firefighting, use equipment rather than people in holding areas, and minimize mop-up camps and command posts should also be located upwind of wildfires protective clothing and equipment can also help minimize exposure to smoke and ash firefighters are also at risk of cardiac events including strokes and heart attacks firefighters should maintain good physical fitness fitness programs, medical screening and examination programs which include stress tests can minimize the risks of firefighting cardiac problems other injury hazards wildland firefighters face include slips, trips, falls, burns, scrapes, and cuts from tools and equipment, being struck by trees, vehicles, or other objects, plant hazards such as thorns and poison ivy, snake and animal bites, vehicle crashes, electrocution from power lines or lightning storms, and unstable building structures the u s forest service publishes guidelines for the minimum distance a firefighter should be from a flame fire retardants are used to slow wildfires by inhibiting combustion they are aqueous solutions of ammonium phosphates and ammonium sulfates, as well as thickening agents the decision to apply retardant depends on the magnitude, location and intensity of the wildfire in certain instances, fire retardant may also be applied as a precautionary fire defense measure typical fire retardants contain the same agents as fertilizers fire retardants may also affect water quality through leaching, eutrophication, or misapplication fire retardant\\'s effects on drinking water remain inconclusive dilution factors, including water body size, rainfall, and water flow rates lessen the concentration and potency of fire retardant wildfire debris (ash and sediment) clog rivers and reservoirs increasing the risk for floods and erosion that ultimately slow and/or damage water treatment systems there is continued concern of fire retardant effects on land, water, wildlife habitats, and watershed quality, additional research is needed however, on the positive side, fire retardant (specifically its nitrogen and phosphorus components) has been shown to have a fertilizing effect on nutrient-deprived soils and thus creates a temporary increase in vegetation the current usda procedure maintains that the aerial application of fire retardant in the united states must clear waterways by a minimum of 300 feet to safeguard effects of retardant runoff aerial uses of fire retardants are required to avoid application near waterways and endangered species (plant and animal habitats) after any incident of fire retardant misapplication, the u s forest service requires reporting and assessment impacts be made to determine a mitigation, remediation, and/or restrictions on future retardant uses in that area wildfire modeling is concerned with numerical simulation of wildfires to comprehend and predict fire behavior wildfire modeling aims to aid wildfire suppression, increase the safety of firefighters and the public, and minimize damage using computational science, wildfire modeling involves the statistical analysis of past fire events to predict spotting risks and front behavior various wildfire propagation models have been proposed in the past, including simple ellipses and egg- and fan-shaped models early attempts to determine wildfire behavior assumed terrain and vegetation uniformity however, the exact behavior of a wildfire\\'s front is dependent on a variety of factors, including wind speed and slope steepness modern growth models utilize a combination of past ellipsoidal descriptions and huygens\\' principle to simulate fire growth as a continuously expanding polygon extreme value theory may also be used to predict the size of large wildfires however, large fires that exceed suppression capabilities are often regarded as statistical outliers in standard analyses, even though fire policies are more influenced by large wildfires than by small fires wildfire risk is the chance that a wildfire will start in or reach a particular area and the potential loss of human values if it does risk is dependent on variable factors such as human activities, weather patterns, availability of wildfire fuels, and the availability or lack of resources to suppress a fire wildfires have continually been a threat to human populations however, human-induced geographical and climatic changes are exposing populations more frequently to wildfires and increasing wildfire risk it is speculated that the increase in wildfires arises from a century of wildfire suppression coupled with the rapid expansion of human developments into fire-prone wildlands wildfires are naturally occurring events that aid in promoting forest health global warming and climate changes are causing an increase in temperatures and more droughts nationwide which contributes to an increase in wildfire risk the most noticeable adverse effect of wildfires is the destruction of property however, the release of hazardous chemicals from the burning of wildland fuels also significantly impacts health in humans wildfire smoke is composed primarily of carbon dioxide and water vapor other common smoke components present in lower concentrations are carbon monoxide, formaldehyde, acrolein, polyaromatic hydrocarbons, and benzene small particulates suspended in air which come in solid form or in liquid droplets are also present in smoke 80 -90% of wildfire smoke, by mass, is within the fine particle size class of 2 5 micrometers in diameter or smaller despite carbon dioxide\\'s high concentration in smoke, it poses a low health risk due to its low toxicity rather, carbon monoxide and fine particulate matter, particularly 2 5 µm in diameter and smaller, have been identified as the major health threats other chemicals are considered to be significant hazards but are found in concentrations that are too low to cause detectable health effects the degree of wildfire smoke exposure to an individual is dependent on the length, severity, duration, and proximity of the fire people are exposed directly to smoke via the respiratory tract through inhalation of air pollutants indirectly, communities are exposed to wildfire debris that can contaminate soil and water supplies the u s environmental protection agency (epa) developed the air quality index (aqi), a public resource that provides national air quality standard concentrations for common air pollutants the public can use this index as a tool to determine their exposure to hazardous air pollutants based on visibility range fire ecologist leda kobziar found that wildfire smoke distributes microbial life on a global level she stated, \"there are numerous allergens that we’ve found in the smoke and so it may be that some people who are sensitive to smoke have that sensitivity, not only because of the particulate matter and the smoke but also because there are some biological organisms in it \"it is well-known that debris and chemicals can runoff into waterways after wildfires making the drinking water sources unsafe it is also known that wildfires can damage water treatment facilities making drinking water unsafe though, even when the water sources and treatment facilities are not damaged, drinking water inside buildings and in buried water distribution systems can be chemically contaminated after the 2017 tubbs fire and 2018 camp fire in california hazardous waste levels of chemical contamination were found in multiple public drinking water systems impacted by wildfires since 2018, additional wildfires that damaged drinking water distribution systems and plumbing in california and oregon have caused chemical drinking water contamination benzene is one of many chemicals that has been found in the drinking water systems and buildings after wildfires benzene can permeate certain plastic pipes and thus require long times to remove from the water distribution system infrastructure and building plumbing using a u s environmental protection agency model, researchers estimated more than286 days of constant flushing a single contaminated pipe 24 hours per day, 7 days a week were needed to reduce benzene below safe drinking water limits temperature increases caused by fires, including wildfires, can cause plastic water pipes to generate toxic chemicals such as benzene into the water that they carry suspended sediment inputs to streams and reservoirs alter the colour and murkiness of water, yet because of the chance of transporting particle-associated pollutants elevated suspended sediment concentrations in drink will build it tough to notice microorganism and viruses, increase microorganism development because of high quantities of adsorbate nutrients, and reduce medical aid effectiveness importantly, composite suspended sediment particles, instead of primary particles, might dominate the transit of little cohesive sediments through the stream system microbial communities, organic and inorganic particles, and chemical components are all enclosed within the structure of those composite particles, which may have a negative impact on water quality burned aggregates have a lot of bigger sinking velocities than change state particles of equal diameter, which has been attributed to a rise in burned mixture density because of reduced organic content and pore house moreover, the impact of soil heating has been ascribed to the aggregation of clay particles into coarser composite particles, probably increasing the concentration of pollutants to composite particles relative to primary particles of equivalent size hyperbolic fine sediment storage and maybe delayed unharness of pollutants once fireplace from decaying aggregates are two potential implications of fireplace effects on soil particles after a wildfire, hazards remain residents returning to their homes may be at risk from falling fire-weakened trees humans and pets may also be harmed by falling into ash pits the intergovernmental panel on climate change (ipcc) also reports that wildfires cause significant damage to electric systems, especially in dry regions other post-fire risks, can increase if other extreme weather follows for example, wildfires make soil less able to absorb precipitation, so heavy rainfall can result in more severe flooding and damages like mud slides firefighters are at the greatest risk for acute and chronic health effects resulting from wildfire smoke exposure due to firefighters\\' occupational duties, they are frequently exposed to hazardous chemicals at close proximity for longer periods of time a case study on the exposure of wildfire smoke among wildland firefighters shows that firefighters are exposed to significant levels of carbon monoxide and respiratory irritants above osha-permissible exposure limits (pel) and acgih threshold limit values (tlv) 5–10% are overexposed the study obtained exposure concentrations for one wildland firefighter over a 10-hour shift spent holding down a fireline the firefighter was exposed to a wide range of carbon monoxide and respiratory irritants (a combination of particulate matter 3 5 µm and smaller, acrolein, and formaldehyde) levels carbon monoxide levels reached up to 160ppm and the tlv irritant index value reached a high of 10 in contrast, the osha pel for carbon monoxide is 30ppm and for the tlv respiratory irritant index, the calculated threshold limit value is 1; any value above 1 exceeds exposure limits between 2001 and 2012, over 200 fatalities occurred among wildland firefighters in addition to heat and chemical hazards, firefighters are also at risk for electrocution from power lines; injuries from equipment; slips, trips, and falls; injuries from vehicle rollovers; heat-related illness; insect bites and stings; stress; and rhabdomyolysis residents in communities surrounding wildfires are exposed to lower concentrations of chemicals, but they are at a greater risk for indirect exposure through water or soil contamination exposure to residents is greatly dependent on individual susceptibility vulnerable persons such as children (ages 0–4), the elderly (ages 65 and older), smokers, and pregnant women are at an increased risk due to their already compromised body systems, even when the exposures are present at low chemical concentrations and for relatively short exposure periods they are also at risk for future wildfires and may move away to areas they consider less risky wildfires affect large numbers of people in western canada and the united states in california alone, more than 350,000 people live in towns and cities in \"very high fire hazard severity zones\" direct risks to building residents in fire-prone areas can be moderated through design choices such as choosing fire-resistant vegetation, maintaining landscaping to avoid debris accumulation and to create firebreaks, and by selecting fire-retardant roofing materials potential compounding issues with poor air quality and heat during warmer months may be addressed with merv 11 or higher outdoor air filtration in building ventilation systems, mechanical cooling, and a provision of a refuge area with additional air cleaning and cooling, if needed wildfire smoke contains particulate matter that may have adverse effects upon the human respiratory system evidence of the health effects of wildfire smoke should be relayed to the public so that exposure may be limited evidence of health effects can also be used to influence policy to promote positive health outcomes inhalation of smoke from a wildfire can be a health hazard wildfire smoke is composed of combustion products i e carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, water vapor, particulate matter, organic chemicals, nitrogen oxides and other compounds the principal health concern is the inhalation of particulate matter and carbon monoxide particulate matter (pm) is a type of air pollution made up of particles of dust and liquid droplets they are characterized into three categories based on the diameter of the particle: coarse pm, fine pm, and ultrafine pm coarse particles are between 2 5 micrometers and 10 micrometers, fine particles measure 0 1 to 2 5 micrometers, and ultrafine particle are less than 0 1 micrometer each size can enter the body through inhalation, but the pm impact on the body varies by size coarse particles are filtered by the upper airways and these particles can accumulate and cause pulmonary inflammation this can result in eye and sinus irritation as well as sore throat and coughing coarse pm is often composed of materials that are heavier and more toxic that lead to short-term effects with stronger impact smaller particulate moves further into the respiratory system creating issues deep into the lungs and the bloodstream in asthma patients, pm2 5 causes inflammation but also increases oxidative stress in the epithelial cells these particulates also cause apoptosis and autophagy in lung epithelial cells both processes cause the cells to be damaged and impacts the cell function this damage impacts those with respiratory conditions such as asthma where the lung tissues and function are already compromised the third pm type is ultra-fine pm (ufp) ufp can enter the bloodstream like pm2 5 however studies show that it works into the blood much quicker the inflammation and epithelial damage done by ufp has also shown to be much more severe pm2 5 is of the largest concern in regards to wildfire this is particularly hazardous to the very young, elderly and those with chronic conditions such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd), cystic fibrosis and cardiovascular conditions the illnesses most commonly with exposure to the fine particles from wildfire smoke are bronchitis, exacerbation of asthma or copd, and pneumonia symptoms of these complications include wheezing and shortness of breath and cardiovascular symptoms include chest pain, rapid heart rate and fatigue smoke from wildfires can cause health problems, especially for children and those who already have respiratory problems several epidemiological studies have demonstrated a close association between air pollution and respiratory allergic diseases such as bronchial asthma an observational study of smoke exposure related to the 2007 san diego wildfires revealed an increase both in healthcare utilization and respiratory diagnoses, especially asthma among the group sampled projected climate scenarios of wildfire occurrences predict significant increases in respiratory conditions among young children particulate matter (pm) triggers a series of biological processes including inflammatory immune response, oxidative stress, which are associated with harmful changes in allergic respiratory diseases although some studies demonstrated no significant acute changes in lung function among people with asthma related to pm from wildfires, a possible explanation for these counterintuitive findings is the increased use of quick-relief medications, such as inhalers, in response to elevated levels of smoke among those already diagnosed with asthma in investigating the association of medication use for obstructive lung disease and wildfire exposure, researchers found increases both in the usage of inhalers and initiation of long-term control as in oral steroids more specifically, some people with asthma reported higher use of quick-relief medications (inhalers) after two major wildfires in california, researchers found an increase in physician prescriptions for quick-relief medications in the years following the wildfires than compared to the year before each occurrence there is consistent evidence between wildfire smoke and the exacerbation of asthma asthma is one of the most common chronic disease among children in the united states, affecting an estimated 6 2 million children research on asthma risk focuses specifically on the risk of air pollution during the gestational period several pathophysiology processes are involved are in this considerable airway development occurs during the 2nd and 3rd trimester and continues until 3 years of age it is hypothesized that exposure to these toxins during this period could have consequential effects, as the epithelium of the lungs during this time could have increased permeability to toxins exposure to air pollution during parental and pre-natal stage could induce epigenetic changes which are responsible for the development of asthma studies have found significant association between pm2 5, no2 and development of asthma during childhood despite heterogeneity among studies furthermore, maternal exposure to chronic stressors is most likely present in distressed communities, and as this can be correlated with childhood asthma, it may further explain links between early childhood exposure to air pollution, neighborhood poverty, and childhood risk as well, living in distressed neighborhoods is linked to pollutant source location and exposure and also to greater chronic individual stress, which alters the allostatic load of the maternal immune system in turn, this leads to adverse outcomes in children, including increased susceptibility to air pollution carbon monoxide (co) is a colorless, odorless gas that can be found at the highest concentration at close proximity to a smoldering fire for this reason, carbon monoxide inhalation is a serious threat to the health of wildfire firefighters co in smoke can be inhaled into the lungs where it is absorbed into the bloodstream and reduces oxygen delivery to the body\\'s vital organs at high concentrations, it can cause headaches, weakness, dizziness, confusion, nausea, disorientation, visual impairment, coma, and even death however, even at lower concentrations, such as those found at wildfires, individuals with cardiovascular disease may experience chest pain and cardiac arrhythmia a recent study tracking the number and cause of wildfire firefighter deaths from 1990–2006 found that 21 9% of the deaths occurred from heart attacks another important and somewhat less obvious health effect of wildfires is psychiatric diseases and disorders both adults and children from countries ranging from the united states and canada to greece and australia who were directly and indirectly affected by wildfires were found by researchers to demonstrate several different mental conditions linked to their experience with the wildfires these include post-traumatic stress disorder (ptsd), depression, anxiety, and phobias the western us has seen an increase in both the frequency and intensity of wildfires over the last several decades this increase has been attributed to the arid climate of the western us and the effects of global warming an estimated 46 million people were exposed to wildfire smoke from 2004 to 2009 in the western united states evidence has demonstrated that wildfire smoke can increase levels of particulate matter in the atmosphere the epa has defined acceptable concentrations of particulate matter in the air, through the national ambient air quality standards and monitoring of ambient air quality has been mandated due to these monitoring programs and the incidence of several large wildfires near populated areas, epidemiological studies have been conducted and demonstrate an association between human health effects and an increase in fine particulate matter due to wildfire smoke the epa has defined acceptable concentrations of particulate matter in the air the national ambient air quality standards are part of the clean air act and provide mandated guidelines for pollutant levels and the monitoring of ambient air quality in addition to these monitoring programs, the increased incidence of wildfires near populated areas has precipitated several epidemiological studies such studies have demonstrated an association between negative human health effects and an increase in fine particulate matter due to wildfire smoke the size of the particulate matter is significant as smaller particulate matter (fine) is easily inhaled into the human respiratory tract often, small particulate matter can be inhaled into deep lung tissue causing respiratory distress, illness, or disease an increase in pm smoke emitted from the hayman fire in colorado in june 2002, was associated with an increase in respiratory symptoms in patients with copd looking at the wildfires in southern california in october 2003 in a similar manner, investigators have shown an increase in hospital admissions due to asthma symptoms while being exposed to peak concentrations of pm in smoke another epidemiological study found a 7 2% (95% confidence interval: 0 25%, 15%) increase in risk of respiratory related hospital admissions during smoke wave days with high wildfire-specific particulate matter 2 5 compared to matched non-smoke-wave days children participating in the children\\'s health study were also found to have an increase in eye and respiratory symptoms, medication use and physician visits recently, it was demonstrated that mothers who were pregnant during the fires gave birth to babies with a slightly reduced average birth weight compared to those who were not exposed to wildfire during birth suggesting that pregnant women may also be at greater risk to adverse effects from wildfire worldwide it is estimated that 339,000 people die due to the effects of wildfire smoke each year while the size of particulate matter is an important consideration for health effects, the chemical composition of particulate matter (pm2 5) from wildfire smoke should also be considered antecedent studies have demonstrated that the chemical composition of pm2 5 from wildfire smoke can yield different estimates of human health outcomes as compared to other sources of smoke health outcomes for people exposed to wildfire smoke may differ from those exposed to smoke from alternative sources such as solid fuels the first evidence of wildfires is rhyniophytoid plant fossils preserved as charcoal, discovered in the welsh borders, dating to the silurian period (about 420\\xa0million years ago) smoldering surface fires started to occur sometime before the early devonian period 405\\xa0million years ago low atmospheric oxygen during the middle and late devonian was accompanied by a decrease in charcoal abundance additional charcoal evidence suggests that fires continued through the carboniferous period later, the overall increase of atmospheric oxygen from 13% in the late devonian to 30–31% by the late permian was accompanied by a more widespread distribution of wildfires later, a decrease in wildfire-related charcoal deposits from the late permian to the triassic periods is explained by a decrease in oxygen levels wildfires during the paleozoic and mesozoic periods followed patterns similar to fires that occur in modern times surface fires driven by dry seasons[clarification needed] are evident in devonian and carboniferous progymnosperm forests lepidodendron forests dating to the carboniferous period have charred peaks, evidence of crown fires in jurassic gymnosperm forests, there is evidence of high frequency, light surface fires the increase of fire activity in the late tertiary is possibly due to the increase of c4-type grasses as these grasses shifted to more mesic habitats, their high flammability increased fire frequency, promoting grasslands over woodlands however, fire-prone habitats may have contributed to the prominence of trees such as those of the genera eucalyptus, pinus and sequoia, which have thick bark to withstand fires and employ pyriscence the human use of fire for agricultural and hunting purposes during the paleolithic and mesolithic ages altered the preexisting landscapes and fire regimes woodlands were gradually replaced by smaller vegetation that facilitated travel, hunting, seed-gathering and planting in recorded human history, minor allusions to wildfires were mentioned in the bible and by classical writers such as homer however, while ancient hebrew, greek, and roman writers were aware of fires, they were not very interested in the uncultivated lands where wildfires occurred wildfires were used in battles throughout human history as early thermal weapons from the middle ages, accounts were written of occupational burning as well as customs and laws that governed the use of fire in germany, regular burning was documented in 1290 in the odenwald and in 1344 in the black forest in the 14th century sardinia, firebreaks were used for wildfire protection in spain during the 1550s, sheep husbandry was discouraged in certain provinces by philip ii due to the harmful effects of fires used in transhumance as early as the 17th century, native americans were observed using fire for many purposes including cultivation, signaling, and warfare scottish botanist david douglas noted the native use of fire for tobacco cultivation, to encourage deer into smaller areas for hunting purposes, and to improve foraging for honey and grasshoppers charcoal found in sedimentary deposits off the pacific coast of central america suggests that more burning occurred in the 50 years before the spanish colonization of the americas than after the colonization in the post-world war ii baltic region, socio-economic changes led more stringent air quality standards and bans on fires that eliminated traditional burning practices in the mid-19th century, explorers from hms\\xa0beagle observed australian aborigines using fire for ground clearing, hunting, and regeneration of plant food in a method later named fire-stick farming such careful use of fire has been employed for centuries in the lands protected by kakadu national park to encourage biodiversity wildfires typically occurred during periods of increased temperature and drought an increase in fire-related debris flow in alluvial fans of northeastern yellowstone national park was linked to the period between ad 1050 and 1200, coinciding with the medieval warm period however, human influence caused an increase in fire frequency dendrochronological fire scar data and charcoal layer data in finland suggests that, while many fires occurred during severe drought conditions, an increase in the number of fires during 850 bc and 1660 ad can be attributed to human influence charcoal evidence from the americas suggested a general decrease in wildfires between 1 ad and 1750 compared to previous years however, a period of increased fire frequency between 1750 and 1870 was suggested by charcoal data from north america and asia, attributed to human population growth and influences such as land clearing practices this period was followed by an overall decrease in burning in the 20th century, linked to the expansion of agriculture, increased livestock grazing, and fire prevention efforts a meta-analysis found that 17 times more land burned annually in california before 1800 compared to recent decades (1,800,000 hectares/year compared to 102,000 hectares/year) according to a paper published in the journal science, the number of natural and human-caused fires decreased by 24 3% between 1998 and 2015 researchers explain this a transition from nomadism to settled lifestyle and intensification of agriculture that lead to a drop in the use of fire for land clearing increases of certain tree species (i e conifers) over others (i e deciduous trees) can increase wildfire risk, especially if these trees are also planted in monoculturessome invasive species, moved in by humans (i e , for the pulp and paper industry) have in some cases also increased the intensity of wildfires examples include species such as eucalyptus in california and gamba grass in australia wildfires have a place in many cultures \"to spread like wildfire\" is a common idiom in english, meaning something that \"quickly affects or becomes known by more and more people\" the smokey bear fire prevention campaign has yielded one of the most popular characters in the united states; for many years there was a living smokey bear mascot, and it has been commemorated on postage stamps wildfire activity has been attributed as a major factor in the development of ancient greece in modern greece, as in many other regions, it is the most common natural disaster and figures prominently in the social and economic lives of its people in regards to communicating information to the public regarding wildfire safety, some of the most effective ways to communicate with others about wildfires are community outreach conducted through presentations to homeowners and neighborhood associations, community events such as festivals and county fairs, and youth programs attributionthe extinction risk of climate change is the risk of species becoming extinct due to the effects of climate change climate change is the long-term conversion of temperature and average weather patterns currently, 19% of species on the iucn red list of threatened species are already being impacted by climate change many studies have been conducted on how climate change can affect global temperatures and environment studies done by the intergovernmental panel on climate change (ipcc) show that it is estimated that the temperature will rise from about 1 4 to 5 5 degrees celsius (2 5 to 10 degrees fahrenheit) within the next century temperature rise of 1 5\\xa0°c to 2 0\\xa0°c may see the geographic range of many insects, plants and vertebrates decrease significantly efforts like paris agreement attempt to reduce further warming and help ecosystems adapt the effects of a rising temperaturethe scientific consensus in the 2014 ipcc fifth assessment report is that:a large fraction of both terrestrial and freshwater species faces increased extinction risk under projected climate change during and beyond the 21st century, especially as climate change interacts with other stressors, such as habitat modification, over-exploitation, pollution, and invasive species extinction risk is increased under all rcp scenarios, with risk increasing with both magnitude and rate of climate change many species will be unable to track suitable climates under mid- and high-range rates of climate change during the 21st century lower rates of climate change will pose fewer problems some predictions of how life would be affected:temperature increase has affected and will continue to affect the amount of rainfall rain will fall in more extreme storms carrying more moisture this \\'boom or bust\\' precipitation affects plant growth, and increasing temperature also leads to desertification this would further spread in other issues including overgrazing and loss of biodiversity the effects of climate change on oceans include the rise in sea level from ocean warming and ice sheet melting, and changes in ph value (ocean acidification), circulation, and stratification due to changing temperatures leading to changes in oxygen concentrations there is clear evidence that the earth is warming due to anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases and leading inevitably to ocean warming the greenhouse gases taken up by the ocean (via carbon sequestration) help to mitigate climate change but lead to ocean acidification the effects of climate change on agriculture can result in lower crop yields and nutritional quality due to for example drought, heat waves and flooding as well as increases in pests and plant diseases the effects are unevenly distributed across the world and are caused by changes in temperature, precipitation and atmospheric carbon dioxide levels due to global climate change in 2019, millions already suffer from food insecurity due to climate change and predicted decline in global crop production of 2% - 6% by decade it has been predicted in 2019 that food prices will rise by 80% by 2050 which will likely lead to food insecurity, disproportionally affecting poorer communities a 2021 study estimates that the severity of heatwave and drought impacts on crop production tripled over the last 50 years in europe – from losses of 2 2% during 1964–1990 to losses of 7 3% in 1991–2015 in one study published in nature in 2004 found that between 15 and 37% of 1103 endemic or near-endemic known plant and animal species will be \"committed to extinction\" by 2050 more properly, changes in habitat by 2050 will put them outside the survival range for the inhabitants, thus committing the species to extinction other researchers, such as thuiller et al , araújo et al , person et al , buckley and roughgarden, and harte et al have raised concern regarding uncertainty in thomas et al \\'s projections; some of these studies believe it is an overestimate, others believe the risk could be greater thomas et al replied in nature  addressing criticisms and concluding \"although further investigation is needed into each of these areas, it is unlikely to result in substantially reduced estimates of extinction anthropogenic climate change seems set to generate very large numbers of species-level extinctions \" on the other hand, daniel botkin et al state \"   global estimates of extinctions due to climate change (thomas et al 2004) may have greatly overestimated the probability of extinction   \"mechanistic studies are documenting extinctions due to recent climate change: mclaughlin et al documented two populations of bay checkerspot butterfly being threatened by precipitation change parmesan states, \"few studies have been conducted at a scale that encompasses an entire species\" and mclaughlin et al agreed \"few mechanistic studies have linked extinctions to recent climate change \"in 2008, the white lemuroid possum was reported to be the first known mammal species to be driven extinct by climate change however, these reports were based on a misunderstanding one population of these possums in the mountain forests of north queensland is severely threatened by climate change as the animals cannot survive extended temperatures over 30\\xa0°c however, another population 100 kilometres south remains in good health the risk of extinction does need to lead to a demonstrable extinction process to validate future extinctions attributable to climate change in a study led by barry sinervo, a mathematical-biologist at the university of california santa cruz, researchers analyzed observed contemporary extinctions (since dramatic modern climate warming began in 1975) results of the study indicate that climate-forced extinctions of lizard families of the world have already started the model is premised on the ecophysiological limits of an organism being exceeded in the case of lizards, this occurs when their preferred body temperature is exceeded in their local environment lizards are ectotherms that regulate body temperature using heat sources of their local environment (the sun, warm air temperatures, or warm rocks) surveys of 200 sites in mexico showed 24 local extinctions (= extirpations), of sceloporus lizards using a model developed from these observed extinctions the researchers surveyed other extinctions around the world and found that the model predicted those observed extirpations, thus attributing the extirpations around the world to climate warming these models predict that extinctions of the lizard species around the world will reach 20% by 2080, but up to 40% extinctions in tropical ecosystems where the lizards are closer to their ecophysiological limits than lizards in the temperate zone according to research published in the january 4, 2012 proceedings of the royal society b current climate models may be flawed because they overlook two important factors: the differences in how quickly species relocate and competition among species according to the researchers, led by mark c urban, an ecologist at the university of connecticut, diversity decreased when they took these factors into account, and that new communities of organisms, which do not exist today, emerged as a result, the rate of extinctions may be higher than previously projected according to research published in the 30 may 2014 issue of science, most known species have small ranges, and the numbers of small-ranged species are increasing quickly they are geographically concentrated and are disproportionately likely to be threatened or already extinct according to the research, current rates of extinction are three orders of magnitude higher than the background extinction rate, and future rates, which depend on many factors, are poised to increase although there has been rapid progress in developing protected areas, such efforts are not ecologically representative, nor do they optimally protect biodiversity in the researchers\\' view, human activity tends to destroy critical habitats where species live, warms the planet, and tends to move species around the planet to places where they do not belong and where they can come into conflict with human needs (e g causing species to become pests) according to a long-term study of more than 60 bee species published in the journal science said that climate change effects drastic declines in the population and diversity of bumblebees across north america and europe this research showed that bumblebees are disappearing at rates \"consistent with a mass extinction \" north america\\'s bumblebee populations fell by 46% during the two time periods the study used, which were from 1901 to 1974 and from 2000 to 2014 north america\\'s bumblebee populations fell by 46% because bee populations were hardest hit in warming southern regions such as mexico according to the study, there have been more frequent extreme warm years, which exceeded the species’ historical temperature ranges in 2016, the bramble cay melomys, which lived on a great barrier reef island, was reported to probably be the first mammal to become extinct because of sea level rises due to human-made climate change extinction risks of the adelie penguin are being reported because of climate change the adelie penguin (pygoscelis adeliae) species is declining and data analysis done on the breeding colonies is used to estimate and project future habitat and population sustainability in relation to warming sea temperatures by 2060, one-third of the observed adelie penguin colony along the west antarctic peninsula (wap) will be in decline the adelie penguins are a circumpolar species, used to the ranges of antarctic climate, and experiencing population decline climate model projections predict sanctuary for the species past 2099 the observed population is similarly proportional to the species-wide population (one-third of the observed population is equal to 20% of the species-wide population) sex ratios for sea turtles in the caribbean are being affected because of climate change environmental data were collected from the annual rainfall and tide temperatures over the course of 200 years and showed an increase in air temperature (mean of 31 0 degree celsius) these data were used to relate the decline of the sex ratios of sea turtles in the north east caribbean and climate change the species of sea turtles include dermochelys coriacea, chelonia myads, and eretmochelys imbricata extinction is a risk for these species as the sex ratio is being afflicted causing a higher female to male ratio projections estimate the declining rate of male chelonia myads as 2 4% hatchlings being male by 2030 and 0 4% by 2090 according to the world wildlife fund, the jaguar  is already \"near threatened\" and the loss of food supplies and habitat due to the fires make the situation more critical the fires affect water chemistry (such as decreasing the amount of dissolved oxygen in the water), temperature, and erosion rates, which in turn affects fish and mammals that depend on fish, such as the giant otter (pteronura brasiliensis) the unprecedented fires of the 2019–20 australian bushfire season that swept through 18 million acres (7 million hectares) claimed 29 human lives and stressed australia\\'s wildlife before the fires, only 500 tiny kangaroo island dunnarts (sminthopsis aitkeni) lived on one island; after half the island was burned, it is possible only one survived bramble cay melomys (melomys rubicola) became the first known casualty of human-caused climate change in 2015 due to rising sea levels and repeated storm surges; the greater stick-nest rat (leporillus conditor) may be next emus (dromaius novaehollandiae) are not in danger of total extinction, although they might suffer local extinctions as a result of bushfires; in northern new south wales, coastal emus could be wiped out by fire  the loss of 8,000 koalas (phascolarctos cinereus) in nsw alone was significant, and the animals are endangered but not functionally extinct a february 2020 study found that one-third of all plant and animal species could be extinct by 2070 as a result of climate change bbc reported on a 2020 study done saying that polar bears could go extinct by 2100 if nothing is done to address climate change arctic sea ice has been shrinking from the warming of the planet, polar bears rely on the sea ice to hunt seals so they don\\'t have to go on the shore the melting of sea ice could force polar bear populations to decrease rapidly a 2020 study measured how polar bears \"endurance limits\" as they continue to run out of food and prove to have a difficult time adapting to the warmer arctic temperatures the amount of sea ice that survives for longer than a year has been decreasing by about 13% per decade since the 1970s fossil fuel phase-out is the gradual reduction of the use and production of fossil fuels to zero it is part of the ongoing renewable energy transition current efforts in fossil fuel phase-out involve replacing fossil fuels with sustainable energy sources in sectors such as transport and heating alternatives to fossil fuels include electrification, green hydrogen and biofuel phase-out policies include both demand-side and supply-side constraints whereas demand-side approaches seek to reduce fossil-fuel consumption, supply-side initiatives seek to constraint production to accelerate the pace of energy transition and reduction in emissions while crude oil and natural gas are also being phased out in chemical processes (e g production of new building blocks for plastics) as the circular economy and biobased economy (e g bioplastics) are being developed to reduce plastic pollution, the fossil fuel phase out specifically aims to end the burning of fossil fuels and the consequent production of greenhouse gases therefore, attempts to reduce the use of oil and gas in the plastic industry do not form part of fossil fuel phase-out or reduction plans coal use peaked in 2013 but to meet the paris agreement target of keeping global warming to well below 2\\xa0°c (3 6\\xa0°f) coal use needs to halve from 2020 to 2030 however as of 2017[update], coal supplied over a quarter of the world\\'s primary energy and about 40% of the greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuels phasing out coal has short-term health and environmental benefits which exceed the costs, and without it the 2\\xa0°c target in the paris agreement cannot be met; but some countries still favor coal, and there is much disagreement about how quickly it should be phased out as of 2018[update], 30 countries and many sub-national governments and businesses had become members of the powering past coal alliance, each making a declaration to advance the transition away from unabated coal power generation as of 2019[update], however, the countries which use the most coal have not joined, and some countries continue to build and finance new coal-fired power stations a just transition from coal is supported by the european bank for reconstruction and development in 2019 the un secretary general said that countries should stop building new coal power plants from 2020 or face \\'total disaster\\' in 2020, although china built some plants, globally more coal power was retired than built: the un secretary general has said that oecd countries should stop generating electricity from coal by 2030 and the rest of the world by 2040 crude oil is refined into fuel oil, diesel and gasoline the refined products are primarily for transportation by conventional cars, trucks, trains, planes and ships popular alternatives are human-powered transport, public transport, electric vehicles, and biofuels natural gas is widely used to generate electricity and has an emission intensity of about 500g/kwh heating is also a major source of carbon dioxide emissions leaks are also a large source of atmospheric methane in some countries natural gas is being used as a temporary \"bridge fuel\" to replace coal, in turn to be replaced by renewable sources or a hydrogen economy however this \"bridge fuel\" may  significantly extend the use of fossil fuel or strand assets, such as gas-fired power plants built in the 2020s, as the average plant life is 35 years although natural gas assets are likely to be stranded later than oil and coal assets, perhaps not until 2050, some investors are concerned by reputational risk natural gas phase-out is progressing in some regions, for example with increasing use of hydrogen by the european network of transmission system operators for gas (entsog) and changes to building regulations to reduce the use of gas heating commonly cited reasons for phasing out fossil fuels are to: most of the millions  of premature deaths from air pollution are due to fossil fuels pollution may be indoors e g from heating and cooking, or outdoors from vehicle exhaust one estimate is that the proportion is 65% and the number 3 5 million each year according to professor sir andy haines at the london school of hygiene & tropical medicine the health benefits of phasing out fossil fuels measured in money (estimated by economists using the value of life for each country) are substantially more than the cost of achieving the 2 degree c goal of the paris agreement fossil-fuel phase-out is the largest part of limiting global warming as they account for over 70% of greenhouse gas emissions, but as of 2020[update] needs to move 4 times faster to meet the goals of the paris agreement to achieve the climate goal the vast majority of fossil fuel reserves owned today by countries and companies must remain in the ground the renewable energy transition can create jobs through the construction of new power plants and the manufacturing of the equipment that they need, as was seen in the case of germany and the wind power industry this can also be seen in the case of france and the nuclear power industry france receives about 75% of its electricity from nuclear energy and hundreds of jobs have been created for developing nuclear technology, construction workers, engineers, and radiation protection specialists countries which lack fossil fuel deposits, particularly coal but also petroleum and natural gas, often cite energy independence in their shift away from fossil fuels in switzerland the decision to  electrify virtually the entire  railway network was taken in light of the two world wars (during which switzerland was neutral) when coal imports became increasingly difficult as switzerland has ample hydropower resources, electric trains (as opposed to those driven by steam locomotives or diesel) could be run on domestic energy resources, reducing the need for coal imports the 1973 oil crisis also led to a shift in energy policy in many places to become (more) independent of fossil fuel imports in france the government announced  an ambitious plan to expand nuclear power which by the end of the 1980s had shifted france\\'s electricity sector almost entirely away from coal gas and oil and towards nuclear power the trend towards encouraging cycling in the netherlands and denmark also coincided with the 1973 oil crisis and aimed in part at reducing the need for oil imports in the transportation sector fossil fuel subsidies in 2019 for consumption totalled usd 320 billion spread over many countries according to the international monetary fund: \"the absence of public support for subsidy reform is in part due to a lack of confidence in the ability of governments to shift the resulting budgetary savings to programs that would compensate the poor and middle class for the higher energy prices they face \"rice university center for energy studies academics krane, matar and monaldi suggest the following steps for countries:1 countries should commit to a specific time frame for a full phaseout of implicit and explicit fossil fuel subsidies 2 clarify the language on subsidy reform to remove ambiguous terminology 3 seek formal legislation in affected countries that codifies reform pathways and reduces opportunities for backsliding 4 publish transparent formulas for market-linked pricing, and adhere to a regular schedule for price adjustments 5 phase-in full reforms in a sequence of gradual steps increasing prices gradually but on a defined schedule signals intent to consumers while allowing time to invest in energy efficiency to partially offset the increases 6 aspire to account for externalities over time by imposing a fee or tax on fossil energy products and services, and eliminating preferences for fossil fuels that remain embedded in the tax code 7 use direct cash transfers to maintain benefits for poor segments of society rather than preserving subsidized prices for vulnerable socioeconomic groups 8 launch a comprehensive public communications campaign 9 any remaining fossil fuel subsidies should be clearly budgeted at full international prices and paid for by the national treasury 10 document price and emissions changes with reporting requirements in 2015, greenpeace and climate action network europe released a report highlighting the need for an active phase-out of coal-fired generation across europe their analysis derived from a database of 280 coal plants and included emissions data from official eu registries a 2016 report by oil change international, concludes that the carbon emissions embedded in the coal, oil, and gas in currently working mines and fields, assuming that these run to the end of their working lifetimes, will take the world to just beyond the 2\\u202f°c limit contained in the 2015 paris agreement and even further from the 1 5\\u202f°c goal the report observes that \"one of the most powerful climate policy levers is also the simplest: stop digging for more fossil fuels\" :\\u200a5\\u200ain 2016, the overseas development institute (odi) and 11 other ngos released a report on the impact of building new coal-fired power plants in countries where a significant proportion of the population lacks access to electricity the report concludes that, on the whole, building coal-fired power plants does little to help the poor and may make them poorer moreover, wind and solar generation are beginning to challenge coal on cost a 2018 study in nature energy, suggests that 10 countries in europe could completely phase out coal-fired electricity generation with their current infrastructure, whilst the united states and russia could phase out at least 30% in 2020, the fossil fuel cuts database provided the first global account of supply-side initiatives to constrain fossil fuel production the latest update of the database recorded 1967 initiatives implemented between 1988 and october 2021 in 110 countries across seven major types of supply-side approaches (divestment, n=1201; blockades, n= 374; litigation, n= 192; moratoria and bans, n= 146; production subsidies removal, n=31; carbon tax on fossil fuel production, n=16; emissions trading schemes, n= 7) the gegalo index of geopolitical gains and losses assesses how the geopolitical position of 156 countries may change if the world fully transitions to renewable energy resources former fossil fuel exporters are expected to lose power, while the positions of former fossil fuel importers and countries rich in renewable energy resources is expected to strengthen multiple decarbonisation plans that get to zero co2 emissions have been presented a guardian investigation showed in 2022, that big fossil fuel firms continue to plan huge investments in new fossil fuel production projects that would drive the climate past internationally agreed temperature limits in june 2021 dr sven teske and dr sarah niklas from the institute for sustainable futures, university of technology sydney found that \"existing coal, oil and gas production puts the world on course to overshoot paris climate targets \" in co-operation with the fossil fuel non-proliferation treaty initiative they published a report entitled, fossil fuel exit strategy: an orderly wind down of coal, oil, and gas to meet the paris agreement it analyses global renewable energy potential, and finds that \"every region on earth can replace fossil fuels with renewable energy to keep warming below 1 5ºc and provide reliable energy access to all \"in september 2021, the first scientific assessment of the minimum amount of fossil fuels that would need to be secured from extraction per region as well as globally, to allow for a 50% probability of limiting global warming by 2050 to 1 5\\u2009°c was provided the phase-out of fossil fuels involves many challenges, and one of them is the reliance that currently the world has on them in 2014, fossil fuels provided 81 1% of the primary energy consumption of the world, with approximately 465 exajoules (11,109 megatonnes of oil equivalent) this number is composed by 179\\xa0ej (4,287\\xa0mtoe) of oil consumption; 164\\xa0ej (3,918\\xa0mtoe) of coal consumption, and 122\\xa0ej (2,904\\xa0mtoe)  of natural gas consumption fossil fuel phase-out may lead to an increment in electricity prices, because of the new investments needed to replace their share in the electricity mix with alternative energy sources another impact of a phase-out of fossil fuels is in employment in the case of employment in the fossil fuel industry, a phase-out is logically undesired, therefore, people employed in the industry will usually oppose any measures that put their industries under scrutiny endre tvinnereim and elisabeth ivarsflaten studied the relationship between employment in the fossil fuel industry with the support to climate change policies they proposed that one opportunity for displaced drilling employments in the fossil fuel industry could be in the geothermal energy industry this was suggested as a result of their conclusion: people and companies in the fossil fuel industry will likely oppose measures that endanger their employment, unless they have other stronger alternatives this can be extrapolated to political interests, that can push against the phase-out of fossil fuels initiative one example is how the vote of united states congress members is related to the preeminence of fossil fuel industries in their respective states other challenges include ensuring sustainable recycling, sourcing of the required materials, disruptions of existing power structures, managing variable renewable energy, developing optimal national transition policies, transforming transportation infrastructure and responsibilities of fossil fuel extraction prevention there is active research and development on such issues [additional citation(s) needed]china has pledged to become carbon neutral by 2060, which would need a just transition for over 3 million workers in the coal-mining and power industry it is not yet clear whether china aims to phase-out all fossil fuel use by that date or whether a small proportion will still be in use with the carbon captured and stored in 2021, coal mining was ordered to run at maximum capacity at the end of 2019, the european union launched its european green deal it included:it also leans on horizon europe, to play a pivotal role in leveraging national public and private investments through partnerships with industry and member states, it will support research and innovation on transport technologies, including batteries, clean hydrogen, low-carbon steel making, circular bio-based sectors and the built environment india is confident of exceeding paris cop commitments in the paris agreement, india has committed to an intended nationally determined contributions target of achieving 40% of its total electricity generation from non-fossil fuel sources by 2030 japan has pledged to become carbon neutral by 2050 the uk is legally committed to be carbon neutral by 2050, and moving away from the heating of homes by natural gas is likely to be the most difficult part of the country\\'s fossil fuel phase out alternative energy refers to any source of energy that can substitute the role of fossil fuels renewable energy, or energy that is harnessed from renewable sources, is an alternative energy however, alternative energy can refer to non renewable sources as well, like nuclear energy between the alternative sources of energy are: solar energy, hydroelectricity, marine energy, wind energy, geothermal energy, biofuels, ethanol and hydrogen energy efficiency is complementary to the use of alternative energy sources, when phasing-out fossil fuels renewable energy is energy that is collected from renewable resources that are naturally replenished on a human timescale it includes sources such as sunlight, wind, water (rain, tides, waves), and geothermal heat although most renewable energy sources are sustainable, some are not for example, some biomass sources are considered unsustainable at current rates of exploitation renewable energy often provides energy for electricity generation to a grid, air and water heating/cooling, and stand-alone power systems about 20% of humans\\' global energy consumption is renewables, including almost 30% of electricity about 7% of energy consumption is traditional biomass, but this is declining over 4% of energy consumption is heat energy from modern renewables, such as solar water heating, and over 6% electricity globally there are over 10 million jobs associated with the renewable energy industries, with solar photovoltaics being the largest renewable employer renewable energy systems are rapidly becoming more efficient and cheaper and their share of total energy consumption is increasing, with a large majority of worldwide newly installed electricity capacity being renewable in most countries, photovoltaic solar or onshore wind are the cheapest new-build electricity many nations around the world already have renewable energy contributing more than 20% of their total energy supply, with some generating over half their electricity from renewables a few countries generate all their electricity using renewable energy national renewable energy markets are projected to continue to grow strongly in the 2020s and beyond studies have shown that a global transition to 100% renewable energy across all sectors – power, heat, transport and desalination – is feasible and economically viable renewable energy resources exist over wide geographical areas, in contrast to fossil fuels, which are concentrated in a limited number of countries deployment of renewable energy and energy efficiency technologies is resulting in significant energy security, climate change mitigation, and economic benefits however renewables are being hindered by hundreds of billions of dollars of fossil fuel subsidies in international public opinion surveys there is strong support for renewables such as solar power and wind power but the international energy agency said in 2021 that to reach net zero carbon emissions more effort is needed to increase renewables, and called for generation to increase by about 12% a year to 2030 in 2015, hydroelectric energy generated 16 6% of the world\\'s total electricity and 70% of all renewable electricity in europe and north america environmental concerns around land flooded by large reservoirs ended 30 years of dam construction in the 1990s since then large dams and reservoirs continue to be built in countries like china, brazil and india run-of-the-river hydroelectricity and small hydro have become popular alternatives to conventional dams that may create reservoirs in environmentally sensitive areas wind power or wind energy is mostly the use of wind turbines to generate electricity wind power is a popular, sustainable, renewable energy source that has a much smaller impact on the environment than burning fossil fuels historically, wind power has been used in sails, windmills and windpumps but today it is mostly used to generate electricity wind farms consist of many individual wind turbines, which are connected to the electric power transmission network new onshore (on-land) wind farms are cheaper than new  coal or gas plants, but expansion of wind power is being hindered by fossil fuel subsidies onshore wind farms have a greater visual impact on the landscape than some other power stations small onshore wind farms can feed some energy into the grid or provide power to isolated off-grid locations offshore wind farms provide a steadier and stronger source of energy and have less visual impact although there is less offshore wind power at present and construction and maintenance costs are higher, it is expanding wind power is variable renewable energy, so power-management techniques are used to match supply and demand, such as: wind hybrid power systems, hydroelectric power or other dispatchable power sources, excess capacity, geographically distributed turbines, exporting and importing power to neighboring areas, or grid storage as the proportion of wind power in a region increases the grid may need to be upgraded weather forecasting allows the electric-power network to be readied for the predictable variations in production that occur in 2017, solar power provided 1 7% of total worldwide electricity production, growing at 35% per annum by 2020 the solar contribution to global final energy consumption is expected to exceed 1% solar photovoltaic cells convert sunlight into electricity and many solar photovoltaic power stations have been built the size of these stations has increased progressively over the last decade with frequent new capacity records many of these plants are integrated with agriculture and some use innovative tracking systems that follow the sun\\'s daily path across the sky to generate more electricity than conventional fixed-mounted systems solar power plants have no fuel costs or emissions during operation concentrating solar power (csp) systems use lenses or mirrors and tracking systems to focus a large area of sunlight into a small beam the concentrated heat is then used as a heat source for a conventional power plant a wide range of concentrating technologies exists; the most developed are the parabolic trough, the concentrating linear fresnel reflector, the stirling dish and the solar power tower various techniques are used to track the sun and focus light in all of these systems a working fluid is heated by the concentrated sunlight, and is then used for power generation or energy storage the 2014 intergovernmental panel on climate change (ipcc) report identifies nuclear energy as one of the technologies that can  provide electricity with less than 5% of the lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions of coal power there are more than 60 nuclear reactors shown as under construction in the list of nuclear power by country with china leading at 23 globally, more nuclear power reactors have closed than opened in recent years but overall capacity has increased china has stated its plans to double nuclear generation by 2030 india also plans to greatly increase its nuclear power the manhattan 2 project has presented a report that describes how to significantly increase nuclear power via factory automation several countries have enacted laws to cease construction on new nuclear power stations several european countries have debated nuclear phase-outs and others have completely shut down some reactors three nuclear accidents have influenced the slowdown of nuclear power: the 1979 three mile island accident in the united states, the 1986 chernobyl disaster in the ussr, and the 2011 fukushima nuclear disaster in japan following the march 2011 fukushima nuclear disaster, germany has permanently shut down eight of its 17 reactors and pledged to close the rest by the end of 2022 italy voted overwhelmingly to keep their country non-nuclear switzerland and spain have banned the construction of new reactors japan\\'s prime minister has called for a dramatic reduction in japan\\'s reliance on nuclear power taiwan\\'s president did the same shinzō abe, prime minister of japan since december 2012, announced a plan to restart some of the 54 japanese nuclear power plants and to continue some nuclear reactors under construction as of 2016, countries such as australia, austria, denmark, greece, malaysia, new zealand, and norway have no nuclear power stations and remain opposed to nuclear power germany, italy, spain and switzerland are phasing-out their nuclear power despite this, most pathways for spurring a fossil fuel phase-out that keeps pace with global electricity demands include the expansion of nuclear power, according to the ipcc likewise, the united nations economic commission for europe has stated that global climate objectives would likely not be met without nuclear expansion cost overruns, construction delays, the threat of catastrophic accidents, and regulatory hurdles often make nuclear power plant expansion practically infeasible some companies and organizations have proposed plans aimed at mitigating the cost, duration, and risk of nuclear power plant construction nuscale power, for example, has received regulatory approval from the nuclear regulatory commission for a light-water reactor that would theoretically limit the risk of accidents and could be manufactured for less than traditional nuclear plants the energy impact center\\'s open100, a platform that provides open-source blueprints for the construction of a nuclear plant with a 100-megawatt pressurized water reactor, claims that its model could be built in as little as two years for $300 million in both plans, the ability to mass manufacture small modular reactors would theoretically cut down on construction time biomass is biological material from living, or recently living organisms, most often referring to plants or plant-derived materials as a renewable energy source, biomass can either be used directly, or indirectly\\xa0–  once or converted into another type of energy product such as biofuel biomass can be converted to energy in three ways: thermal conversion, chemical conversion, and biochemical conversion using biomass as a fuel produces air pollution in the form of carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, nox (nitrogen oxides), vocs (volatile organic compounds), particulates and other pollutants at levels above those from traditional fuel sources such as coal or natural gas  in some cases (such as with indoor heating and cooking) utilization of wood biomass as a fuel can also produce fewer particulate and other pollutants than open burning as seen in wildfires or direct heat applications black carbon\\xa0–  a pollutant created by combustion of fossil fuels, biofuels, and biomass\\xa0–  is possibly the second largest contributor to global warming :\\u200a56–57\\u200a in 2009 a swedish study of the giant brown haze that periodically covers large areas in south asia determined that it had been principally produced by biomass burning, and to a lesser extent by fossil fuel burning denmark has increased the use of biomass and garbage, and decreased the use of coal moving away from fossil fuels will require changes not only in the way energy is supplied, but in the way it is used, and reducing the amount of energy required to deliver various goods or services is essential [citation needed] opportunities for improvement on the demand side of the energy equation are as rich and diverse as those on the supply side, and often offer significant economic benefits a sustainable energy economy requires commitments to both renewables and efficiency renewable energy and energy efficiency are said to be the \"twin pillars\" of sustainable energy policy the american council for an energy-efficient economy has explained that both resources must be developed in order to stabilize and reduce carbon dioxide emissions:efficiency is essential to slowing the energy demand growth so that rising clean energy supplies can make deep cuts in fossil fuel use if energy use grows too fast, renewable energy development will chase a receding target likewise, unless clean energy supplies come online rapidly, slowing demand growth will only begin to reduce total emissions; reducing the carbon content of energy sources is also needed the iea has stated that renewable energy and energy efficiency policies are complementary tools for the development of a sustainable energy future, and should be developed together instead of being developed in isolation many countries and cities have introduced bans on the sales of new internal combustion engine vehicles, requiring all new cars to be electric vehicles or otherwise powered by clean, non-emitting sources such bans include the united kingdom by 2035 and norway by 2025 many transit authorities are working to purchase only electric buses while also restricting use of ice vehicles in the city center to limit air pollution many us states have a zero-emissions vehicle mandate, incrementally requiring a certain percent of cars sold to be electric the german term de: verkehrswende (\"traffic transition\" analogous to \"energiewende\", energetic transition) calls for a shift from combustion powered road transport to bicycles, walking and rail transport and the replacement of remaining road vehicles with electric traction biofuels, in the form of liquid fuels derived from plant materials, are entering the market however, many of the biofuels that are currently being supplied have been criticised for their adverse impacts on the natural environment, food security, and land use those corporations that continue to invest in new fossil fuel exploration, new fossil fuel exploitation, are really in flagrant breach of their fiduciary duty because the science is abundantly clear that this is something we can no longer do in 2013, the gallup organization determined that 41% of americans wanted less emphasis placed on coal energy, versus 31% who wanted more large majorities wanted more emphasis placed on solar (76%), wind (71%), and natural gas (65%) the us-based environmental defense fund (edf) has taken a stand in favor of natural gas production and hydraulic fracturing, while pressing for stricter environmental controls on gas drilling, as a feasible way to replace coal the organization has funded studies jointly with the petroleum industry on the environmental effects of natural gas production the organization sees natural gas as a way to quickly replace coal, and that natural gas in time will be replaced by renewable energy the policy has been criticized by some environmentalists if you\\'re a young person looking at the future of this planet and looking at what is being done right now, and not done, i believe we have reached the stage where it is time for civil disobedience to prevent the construction of new coal plants that do not have carbon capture and sequestration carbon farming is a name for a variety of agricultural methods aimed at sequestering atmospheric carbon into the soil and in crop roots, wood and leaves the aim of carbon farming is to increase the rate at which carbon is sequestered into soil and plant material with the goal of creating a net loss of carbon from the atmosphere increasing a soil\\'s organic matter content can aid plant growth, increase total carbon content, improve soil water retention capacity and reduce fertilizer use as of 2016, variants of carbon farming reached hundreds of millions of hectares globally, of the nearly 5\\xa0billion hectares (1 2×1010 acres) of world farmland in addition to agricultural activities, forests management is also a tool that is used in carbon farming the practice of carbon farming is often done by individual land owners who are given incentive to use and to integrate methods that will sequester carbon through policies created by governments carbon farming methods will typically have a cost, meaning farmers and land-owners need a way to profit from the use of carbon farming, and different governments will have different programs land management techniques that can be combined with farming include planting/restoring forests, burying biochar produced by anaerobically converted biomass and restoring wetlands (such as marshes and peatlands) carbon farming is one component of climate smart agriculture in part, soil carbon is thought to accumulate when decaying organic matter was physically mixed with soil small roots die and decay while the plant is alive, depositing carbon below the surface more recently, the role of living plants has been emphasized where carbon is released as plants grow soils can contain up to 5% carbon by weight, including decomposing plant and animal matter and biochar about half of soil carbon is found within deep soils about 90% of this is stabilized by mineral-organic associations at least 32 natural resource conservation service (nrcs) practices improve soil health and sequester carbon, along with important co-benefits: increased water retention, hydrological function, biodiversity and resilience approved practices may make farmers eligible for federal funds not all carbon farming techniques have been recommended carbon farming may consider related issues such as groundwater and surface water degradation compared to natural vegetation, cropland soils are depleted in soil organic carbon (soc) when a soil is converted from natural land or semi natural land, such as forests, woodlands, grasslands, steppes and savannas, the soc content in the soil reduces by about 30–40% the loss of carbon through agricultural practices can eventually lead to the loss of soil suitable for agriculture the carbon loss from the soil is due to the removal of plant material containing carbon, via harvesting when land use changes, soil carbon either increases or decreases this change continues until the soil reaches a new equilibrium deviations from this equilibrium can also be affected by varying climate the decrease can be counteracted by increasing carbon input this can be done via several strategies, e g leaving harvest residues on the field, using manure or rotating perennial crops perennial crops have a larger below ground biomass fraction, which increases the soc content globally, soils are estimated to contain >8,580\\xa0gigatons of organic carbon, about ten times the amount in the atmosphere and much more than in vegetation modification of agricultural practices is a recognized method of carbon sequestration as soil can act as an effective carbon sink offsetting as much as 20% of 2010 carbon dioxide emissions annually organic farming and earthworms may be able to more than offset the annual carbon excess of 4 gt/year carbon emission reduction methods in agriculture can be grouped into two categories: reducing and/or displacing emissions and enhancing carbon sequestration reductions include increasing the efficiency of farm operations (e g more fuel-efficient equipment) and interrupting the natural carbon cycle effective techniques (such as the elimination of stubble burning) can negatively impact other environmental concerns (increased herbicide use to control weeds not destroyed by burning) mixing anaerobically burned biochar into soil sequesters approximately 50% of the carbon in the biomass globally up to 12% of the anthropogenic carbon emissions from land use change (0 21 gigatonnes) can be off-set annually in soil, if slash-and-burn is replaced by slash-and-char agriculture and forestry wastes could add some 0 16 gigatonnes/year biofuel production using modern biomass can produce a bio-char by-product through pyrolysis sequestering 30 6\\xa0kg for each gigajoule of energy produced soil-sequestered carbon is easily and verifiably measured carbon farming minimizes disruption to soils over the planting/growing/harvest cycle tillage is avoided using seed drills or similar techniques livestock can trample and/or eat the remains of a harvested field the reduction or complete halt of tilling will create an increase in the soil carbon concentrations of topsoil plowing splits soil aggregates and allows microorganisms to consume their organic compounds the increased microbial activity releases nutrients, initially boosting yield thereafter the loss of structure reduces soil’s ability to hold water and resist erosion, thereby reducing yield livestock, like all animals, are net producers of carbon ruminants like cows and sheep produce not only co2, but also methane due to the microbes residing in their digestive system a small amount of carbon may be sequestered in grassland soils through root exudates and manure by regularly rotating the herd through multiple paddocks (as often as daily) the paddocks can rest/recover between grazing periods this pattern produces stable grasslands with significant fodder annual grasses have shallower roots and die once they’re grazed rotational grazing leads to the replacement of annuals by perennials with deeper roots, which can recover after grazing by contrast, allowing animals to range over a large area for an extended period can destroy the grassland silvopasture involves grazing livestock under tree cover, with trees separated enough to allow adequate sunlight to nourish the grass for example, a farm in mexico planted native trees on a paddock spanning 22 hectares (54 acres) this evolved into a successful organic dairy the operation became a subsistence farm, earning income from consulting/training others rather than from crop production mulching covers the soil around plants with a mulch of wood chips or straw alternatively, crop residue can be left in place to enter the soil as it decomposes compost sequesters carbon in a stable (not easily accessed) form carbon farmers spread it over the soil surface without tilling a 2013 study found that a single compost application significantly and durably increased grassland carbon storage by 25–70% the continuation sequestration likely came from increased water-holding and “fertilization” by compost decomposition both factors support increased productivity both tested sites showed large increases in grassland productivity: a forage increase of 78% in a drier valley site, while a wetter coastal site averaged an increase of 42% ch4 and n2o and emissions did not increase significantly methane fluxes were negligible soil n2o emissions from temperate grasslands amended with chemical fertilizers and manures were orders of magnitude higher another study found that grasslands treated with  5\" of commercial compost began absorbing carbon at an annual rate of nearly 1 5 tons/acre and continued to do so in subsequent years as of 2018, this study had not been replicated cover crops are fast-growing species planted to protect soils from wind and water erosion during the off-growing season the cover crop may be incorporated into the soil to increase soil organic matter legume cover crops can also produce a small amount of nitrogen the carbon content of a soil should not be increased without also ensuring that the relative amount of nitrogen also increases to maintain a healthy soil ecosystem perennial crops offer potential to sequester carbon when grown in multilayered systems one system uses perennial staple crops that grow on trees that are analogs to maize and beans, or vines, palms and herbaceous perennials forestry and agriculture are both land-based human activities that add up to contribute approximately a third of the world\\'s greenhouse gas emissions there is a large interest in reforestation, but in regards to carbon farming most of that reforestation opportunity will be in small patches with trees being planted by individual land owners in exchange for benefits provided by carbon farming programs forestry in carbon farming can be both reforestation, which is restoring forests to areas that were deforested, and afforestation which would be planting forests in areas that were not historically forested not all forests will sequester the same amount of carbon carbon sequestration is dependent on several factors which can include forest age, forest type, amount of biodiversity, the management practices the forest is experiences and climate biodiversity is often thought to be a side benefit of carbon farming, but in forest ecosystems increased biodiversity can increase the rate of carbon sequestration and can be a tool in carbon farming and not just a side benefit a bamboo forest will store less total carbon than most types of mature forest however, it can store a similar total amount of carbon as rubber plantations and tree orchards, and can surpass the total carbon stored in agroforests, palm oil plantations, grasslands and shrublands a bamboo plantation sequesters carbon at a faster rate than a mature forest or a tree plantation however it has been found that only new plantations or plantations with active management will be sequestering carbon at a faster rate than mature forests compared with other fast-growing tree species, bamboo is only superior in its ability to sequester carbon if selectively harvested bamboo forests are especially high in potential for carbon sequestration if the cultivated plant material is turned into durable products that keep the carbon in the plant material for a long period because bamboo is both fast growing and regrows strongly following an annual harvest while bamboo has the ability to store carbon as biomass in cultivated material, more than half of the carbon sequestration from bamboo will be stored as carbon in the soil carbon that is sequestered into the soil by bamboo is stored by the rhizomes and roots which is biomass that will remain in the soil after plant material above the soil is harvested and stored long-term bamboo can be planted in sub-optimal land unsuitable for cultivating other crops and the benefits would include not only carbon sequestration but improving the quality of the land for future crops and reducing the amount of land subject to deforestation the use of carbon emission trading is also available to farmers who use bamboo to gain carbon credit in otherwise uncultivated land therefore, the farming of bamboo timber may have significant carbon sequestration potential blue carbon refers to potential sequestration of carbon dioxide that can occur in both coastal and marine environments for carbon from non-living or living biomass coastal environments that are of interest for carbon sequestration include mangrove forests, seagrass beds and salt marshes, which are all vegetated coastal environments the global area of coastal vegetated ecosystems is fairly small, smaller than the total global area of land forests, but they will have a greater long term sequestration of carbon by trapping sediment large-scale seaweed farming (called \"ocean afforestation\") could sequester huge amounts of carbon wild seaweed will sequester large amount of carbon through dissolved particles of organic matter being transported to deep ocean seafloors where it will become buried and remain for long periods of time currently seaweed farming is done for harvesting as seaweed has several growing uses for food, medicine and biofuel in respect to carbon farming, the potential growth of seaweed for carbon farming would see the harvested seaweed transported to the deep ocean for long-term burial seaweed farming has gathered attention given the limited terrestrial space available for carbon farming practices currently seaweed farming occurs mostly in the asian pacific coastal areas where it has been a rapidly increasing market afforesting just 9% of the ocean could sequester 53 billion tons of carbon dioxide annually [citation needed] the ipcc special report on the ocean and cryosphere in a changing climate recommends \"further research attention\" as a mitigation tactic wetlands are created when water overflows into heavily vegetated soil causing plants to adapt to a flooded ecosystem wetlands can occur in three different regions marine wetlands are found in shallow coastal areas, tidal wetlands are also coastal but are found farther inland, and non-tidal wetlands are found inland and have no affects from tides wetland soil is an important carbon sink; 14 5% of the world\\'s soil carbon is found in wetlands, while only 5 5% of the world\\'s land is composed of wetlands not only are wetlands a great carbon sink, they have many other benefits like collecting floodwater, filtering air and water pollutants, and creating a home for numerous birds, fish, insects, and plants climate change could alter soil carbon storage changing it from a sink to a source with rising temperatures comes an increase in greenhouse gasses from wetlands especially locations with permafrost when this permafrost melts it increases the available oxygen and water in the soil because of this, bacteria in the soil would create large amounts of carbon dioxide and methane to be released into the atmosphere peatlands hold approximately 30% of the carbon in our ecosystem when wetlands are drained for agricultural land and urbanization, because peatlands are so vast, large quantities of carbon decompose and emit co2 into the atmosphere the loss of one peatland could potentially produce more carbon than 175–500 years of methane emissions while the link between climate change and wetlands is still not fully known, it will be soon determined through future removal of wetlands it is also not clear how restored wetlands manage carbon while still being a contributing source of methane however, preserving these areas would help prevent further release of carbon into the atmosphere potential sequestration alternatives to carbon farming include removing co2 from the atmosphere with direct air capture; fertilizing the oceans to prompt algal blooms that after death carry carbon to the sea bottom; storing the carbon dioxide emitted by electricity generation; and crushing and spreading types of rock such as basalt that absorb atmospheric carbon carbon farming is not without its challenges or disadvantages when ecosystem restoration is used as a form of carbon farming, there can be a lack of knowledge that is disadvantageous in project planning ecosystem services are often a side benefit of restoring ecosystems along with carbon farming, but often ecosystem services are ignored in project planning because, unlike carbon sequestration, is not a global commodity that can be traded if and how carbon farming\\'s additional sequestration methods can affect ecosystem services should be researched to determine how different methods and strategies will impact the value an ecosystem service in particular areas one concern to note is that if policy and incentives are only aimed towards carbon sequestration, then carbon farming could actually be harmful to ecosystems carbon farming could inadvertently cause an increase of land clearing and monocultures when species diversity is not a goal of the landscapes project, so there should be attempts to balance the goals of carbon farming and biodiversity should be attempted critics say that the related regenerative agriculture cannot be adopted enough to matter or that it could lower commodity prices the impact of increased soil carbon on yield has yet to be settled [citation needed]another criticism says that no-till practices may increase herbicide use, diminishing or eliminating carbon benefits composting is not an nrcs-approved technique and its impacts on native species and greenhouse emissions during production have not been fully resolved further, commercial compost supplies are too limited to cover large amounts of land in 2011 australia started a cap-and-trade program farmers who sequester carbon can sell carbon credits to companies in need of carbon offsets the country\\'s direct action plan states \"the single largest opportunity for co2 emissions reduction in australia is through bio-sequestration in general, and in particular, the replenishment of our soil carbons \" in studies of test plots over 20 years showed increased microbial activity when farmers incorporated organic matter or reduced tillage soil carbon levels from 1990–2006 declined by 30% on average under continuous cropping incorporating organic matter alone was not enough to build soil carbon nitrogen, phosphorus and sulphur had to be added as well to do so the largest international effort to promote carbon farming is “four per 1,000”, led by france its goal is to increase soil carbon by 0 4% per year through agricultural and forestry changes by 2014 more than 75% of canadian prairies\\' cropland had adopted \"conservation tillage\" and more than 50% had adopted no till twenty-five countries pledged to adopt the practice at the december 2015 paris climate talks in california multiple resource conservation districts (rcds) support local partnerships to develop and implement carbon farming, in 2015 the agency that administers california\\'s carbon-credit exchange began granting credits to farmers who compost grazing lands in 2016 chevrolet partnered with the us department of agriculture (usda) to purchase 40,000 carbon credits from ranchers on 11,000 no-till acres the transaction equates to removing 5,000 cars from the road and was the largest to date in the us in 2017 multiple us states passed legislation in support of carbon farming and soil health other states are considering similar programs climate change adaptation is the process of adjusting to current or expected effects of climate change it is one of the ways to respond to climate change, along with mitigation for humans, adaptation aims to moderate or avoid harm, and exploit opportunities; for natural systems, humans may intervene to help adjustment adaptation actions can be either incremental (actions where the central aim is to maintain the essence and integrity of a system) or transformative (actions that change the fundamental attributes of a system in response to climate change and its impacts) the need for adaptation varies from place to place, depending on the sensitivity and vulnerability to environmental impacts adaptation actions can be grouped into three categories: structural and physical adaptation (this can be grouped into engineering and built environment, technological, ecosystem-based, services); social adaptation (educational, informational, behavioral); and institutional adaptation (economic organizations, laws and regulation, government policies and programs) :\\u200a845\\u200aadaptation is especially important in developing countries since those countries are most vulnerable to climate change and are bearing the brunt of the effects of climate change human adaptive capacity is unevenly distributed across different regions and populations, and developing countries generally have less capacity to adapt adaptive capacity is closely linked to social and economic development in general higher levels of development mean higher adaptive capacity, but some development locks people in to certain patterns or behaviors and the most developed areas may have low adaptation capacity to new types of natural hazards, not previously experienced, relative to more familiar natural hazards the economic costs of adaptation to climate change are likely to cost billions of dollars annually for the next several decades  mw-parser-output  toclimit-2  toclevel-1 ul, mw-parser-output  toclimit-3  toclevel-2 ul,

ipcc sixth assessment report in 2022, climate adaptation was defined as \"the process of adjustment to actual or expected climate and its effects in order to moderate harm or take advantage of beneficial opportunities\", in human systems in natural systems on the other hand, adaptation is \"the process of adjustment to actual climate and its effects\"; human intervention may facilitate this :\\u200aspm-5\\u200athe paris agreement of 2015 requires countries to keep global temperature rise this century to less than 2\\xa0°c above pre-industrial levels, and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1 5\\xa0°c even if emissions are stopped relatively soon, global warming and its effects will last many years due to the inertia of the climate system, so both net zero and adaptation are necessary the projected effects for the environment and for civilization are numerous and varied the main effect is an increasing global average temperature as of 2013[update] the average surface temperature could increase by a further 0 3 to 4 8\\xa0°c (0 5 to 8 6\\xa0°f) by the end of the century this is causing a variety of secondary effects where in many cases the extent of change is uncertain the most important of these are changes in patterns of precipitation, rising sea levels, altered patterns of agriculture, increased extreme weather events, the expansion of the range of tropical diseases, and the opening of new marine trade routes climate change will also have multifaceted social effects including inequity (social inequality), poverty and increased burden on women as main food and care providers for households however, social effects such as increased migration, and conflict over resources like water and land, are generally hard to attribute to climate change as the only or main driver of change potential biophysical effects include sea level rise of 110 to 770 mm (0 36 to 2 5 feet) between 1990 and 2100, repercussions to agriculture, possible slowing of the thermohaline circulation, reductions in the ozone layer, increased intensity and frequency of extreme weather events, lowering of ocean ph, and the spread of tropical diseases such as malaria and dengue fever adaptation can help decrease climate risk via the three risk factors: hazards, vulnerability and exposure impacts of climate hazards (typically natural hazards) may be reduced with the help of ecosystem-based adaptation for instance, flooding may be prevented if mangroves have the ability to dampen storm energy as such, protection of the mangrove ecosystem can be a form of adaptation insurance and livelihood diversification increase resilience and decrease vulnerability further actions to decrease vulnerability include strengthening social protection and building infrastructure more resistant to hazards exposure can be decreased by retreating from areas with high climate risks, such as floodplains and by improving systems for early warnings and evacuations adaptation actions can be grouped into three categories::\\u200a845\\u200athere are a wide variety of adaptation options for flooding:dealing with more frequent drenching rains may required increasing the capacity of stormwater systems, and separating stormwater from blackwater, so that overflows in peak periods do not contaminate rivers one example is the smart tunnel in kuala lumpur new york city produced a comprehensive report for its rebuilding and resiliency initiative after hurricane sandy its efforts include not only making buildings less prone to flooding, but taking steps to reduce the recurrence of specific problems encountered during and after the storm: weeks-long fuel shortages even in unaffected areas due to legal and transportation problems, flooded health care facilities, insurance premium increases, damage to electricity and steam generation in addition to distribution networks, and flooding of subway and roadway tunnels adaptation options to sea level rise can be broadly classified into retreat, accommodate and protect retreating involves moving people and infrastructure to less exposed areas and preventing further development in areas at risk this type of adaptation is potentially disruptive, as displacement of people may lead to tensions accommodation options make societies more flexible to sea level rise examples are the cultivation of food crops that tolerate a high salt content in the soil and making new building standards which require building to be built higher and incur less damage in the case a flood does occur finally, areas can be protected by the construction of dams, dikes and by improving natural defenses in the united states, the environmental protection agency supports the development and maintenance of water supply infrastructure nationwide, especially in coastal cities, and more coastal cities and countries are actively implementing this approach besides, storm surges and flooding can be instantaneous and devastating to cities, and some coastal areas have begun investing in storm water valves to cope with more frequent and severe flooding during high tides glacial lake outburst floods may become a bigger concern due to the retreat of glaciers, leaving behind numerous lakes that are impounded by often weak terminal moraine dams in the past, the sudden failure of these dams has resulted in localized property damage, injury and deaths glacial lakes in danger of bursting can have their moraines replaced with concrete dams (which may also provide hydroelectric power) a significant effect of global climate change is the altering of global rainfall patterns, with certain effects on agriculture rainfed agriculture constitutes 80% of global agriculture many of the 852 million poor people in the world live in parts of asia and africa that depend on rainfall to cultivate food crops climate change will modify rainfall, evaporation, runoff, and soil moisture storage extended drought can cause the failure of small and marginal farms with resultant economic, political and social disruption, more so than this currently occurs agriculture of any kind is strongly influenced by the availability of water changes in total seasonal precipitation or in its pattern of variability are both important the occurrence of moisture stress during flowering, pollination, and grain-filling is harmful to most crops and particularly so to corn, soybeans, and wheat increased evaporation from the soil and accelerated transpiration in the plants themselves will cause moisture stress adaptive ideas include:climate change can threaten food security and water security food systems can be adapted to enhance food security and to prevent future negative impacts from climate change the demand for water for irrigation is projected to rise in a warmer climate, bringing increased competition between agriculture—already the largest consumer of water resources in semi-arid regions—and urban as well as industrial users falling water tables and the resulting increase in the energy needed to pump water will make the practice of irrigation more expensive, particularly when with drier conditions more water will be required per acre other strategies will be needed to make the most efficient use of water resources for example, the international water management institute has suggested five strategies that could help asia feed its growing population in light of climate change these are: modernising existing irrigation schemes to suit modern methods of farming; supporting farmers\\' efforts to find their own water supplies, by tapping into groundwater in a sustainable way; looking beyond conventional \"participatory irrigation management\" schemes, by engaging the private sector; expanding capacity and knowledge; investing outside the irrigation sector a 2020 study projects that regions inhabited by a third of the human population could become as hot as the hottest parts of the sahara within 50 years without a change in patterns of population growth and without migration, unless greenhouse gas emissions are substantially reduced to a limit of 1 5 °c of warming the most affected regions have little adaptive capacity as of 2020 projects to adapt to or to reduce heat include:ecosystems adapt to global warming depending on their resilience to climatic changes humans can help adaptation in ecosystems for biodiversity possible responses include increasing connectivity between ecosystems so that species can migrate on their own to more favorable climate conditions and assisting their migration through human transport of plants or animals protection and restoration of natural and semi-natural areas also helps build resilience, making it easier for ecosystems to adapt many of the actions that promote adaptation in ecosystems, also help humans adapt via ecosystem-based adaptation and nature-based solutions for instance, restoration of natural fire regimes makes catastrophic fires less likely, and reduces the human exposure to this hazard giving rivers more space allows for storage of more water in the natural system, making floods in inhabited areas less likely the provision of green spaces and tree planting creates shade for livestock there is a trade-off between agricultural production and the restoration of ecosystems in some areas furthermore, humans can help ecosystems adapt to and become more resilient against climate change and its impacts for instance, scientific research and development could be used to help coral reefs survive climate change reforestation is one of the ways to stop desertification fueled by anthropogenic climate change and non sustainable land use one of the most important projects is the great green wall that should stop the expansion of sahara desert to the south by 2018 only 15% of it is accomplished, but there are already many positive effects, which include: \"over 12 million acres (5 million hectares) of degraded land has been restored in nigeria; roughly 30 million acres of drought-resistant trees have been planted across senegal; and a whopping 37 million acres of land has been restored in ethiopia – just to name a few of the states involved \" \"many groundwater wells [were] refilled with drinking water, rural towns with additional food supplies, and new sources of work and income for villagers, thanks to the need for tree maintenance \"as climate change is projected to increase frequency and severity of extreme weather events and disasters, adaptation may also include measures towards increased preparedness and relevant disaster response capacities adaptive capacity is the ability of a system (human, natural or managed) to adjust to climate change (including climate variability and extremes) to moderate potential damages, to take advantage of opportunities, or to cope with consequences as a property, adaptive capacity is distinct from adaptation itself those societies that can respond to change quickly and successfully have a high adaptive capacity high adaptive capacity does not necessarily translate into successful adaptation for example, adaptive capacity in western europe is generally considered to be high, and the risks of warmer winters increasing the range of livestock diseases is well documented, but many parts of europe were still badly affected by outbreaks of the bluetongue virus in livestock in 2007 adaptive capacity may include the capacity to produce, widely deploy and develop efficient and sustainable cooling technologies to protect populations against elevated temperatures unmitigated climate change (i e , future climate change without efforts to limit greenhouse gas emissions) would, in the long term, be likely to exceed the capacity of natural, managed and human systems to adapt it has been found that efforts to enhance adaptive capacity can help to reduce vulnerability to climate change in many instances, activities to promote sustainable development can also act to enhance people\\'s adaptive capacity to climate change these activities can include: improving access to resources, reducing poverty, lowering inequities of resources and wealth among groups, improving education and information, improving infrastructure, improving institutional capacity and efficiency, promoting local indigenous practices, knowledge, and experiences others have suggested that certain forms of gender inequity should be addressed at the same time; for example women may have participation in decision-making, or be constrained by lower levels of education researchers at the overseas development institute found that development interventions to increase adaptive capacity have tended not to result in increased agency for local people they argue that this should play a more prominent part in future intervention planning because agency is a central factor in all other aspects of adaptive capacity asset holdings and the ability to convert these resources through institutional and market processes are central to agency migration can be seen as adaptation: people may be able to generate more income, diversify livelihoods, and spread climate risk this contrasts with two other frames around migration and environmental change: migration as a human rights issue and migration as a security issue in the human right\\'s frame, normative implications include developing protection frameworks for migrants, whereas increased border security may be an implication of framing migration as a national security issue sometimes these approaches are combined for the development of solutions (laws and policies) that aim to be both viable, taking national concerns into account, and in accordance with human rights furthermore, there may also be economic aspects of migration – high levels of migration and emigration of skilled workers – that decision-makers in both the – distant or nearby – host country and the country of origin may consider vice versa, climate change could also exacerbate economic insecurity or political instability as causes for migration beyond temperatures and extreme weather events would-be migrants often need access to social and financial capital, such as support networks in the chosen destination and the funds or physical resources to be able to move migration is frequently the last adaptive response households will take when confronted with environmental factors that threaten their livelihoods, and mostly resorted to when other mechanisms to cope have proven unsuccessful migration events are multi-causal, with the environment being just a factor amongst many many discussions around migration are based on projections, while relatively few use current migration data migration related to sudden events like hurricanes, heavy rains, floods, and landslides is often short-distance, involuntary, and temporary slow-impact events, such as droughts and slowly rising temperatures, have more mixed effects people may lose the means to migrate, leading to a net decrease in migration the migration that does take place is seen as voluntary and economically motivated focusing on climate change as the issue may frame the debate around migration in terms of projections, causing the research to be speculative migration as tool for climate change adaptation is projected to be a more pressing issue in the decade to come in africa, specifically, migrant social networks can help to build social capital to increase the social resilience in the communities of origin and trigger innovations across regions by the transfer of knowledge, technology, remittances and other resources in africa, mozambique and zimbabwe are clear examples of adaptation strategies because they have implemented relocation policies that have reduced the exposure of populations and migrants to disaster tools can be put in place that limit forced displacement after a disaster; promote employment programs, even if only temporary, for internally displaced people or establish funding plans to ensure their security; to minimize the vulnerability of populations from risk areas this can limit the displacement caused by environmental shocks and better channel the positive spillovers (money transfers, experiences, etc ) from the migration to the origin countries/communities relocation from the effects of climate change has been brought to light more and more over the years from the constant increasing effects of climate change in the world coastal homes in the u s are in danger from climate change, this is leading residents to relocate to areas that are less affected flooding in coastal areas and drought have been the main reasons for relocation assisted migration is the act of moving plants or animals to a different habitat the destination habitat may or may not have once previously held the species; the only requirement is the destination habitat must provide the bioclimatic requirements to support the species the goal of assisted migration is to remove the species from a threatening environment and give them a chance to survive and reproduce in an environment that does not pose an existential threat to the species in recent years, assisted migration has been presented as a potential solution to the climate change crisis that has changed environments faster than natural selection can adapt to while assisted migration has the potential to allow species that have poor natural dispersal abilities to avoid extinction, it has also sparked intense debate over the possibility of the introduction of invasive species and diseases into previously healthy ecosystems despite these debates, scientists and land managers have already begun the process of assisted migration for certain species in the north american context, assisted migration is most often discussed in the context of the relocalization of the continent\\'s forests in the late 2000s and early 2010s, the canadian provinces of alberta and british columbia modified their tree reseeding guidelines to account for the northward movement of forest\\'s optimal ranges british columbia even gave the green light for the relocation of a single species, the western larch, 1000\\xa0km northward insurance spreads the financial impact of flooding and other extreme weather events although it can be preferable to take a proactive approach to eliminate the cause of the risk, reactive post-harm compensation can be used as a last resort access to reinsurance may be a form of increasing the resiliency of cities where there are failures in the private insurance market, the public sector can subsidize premiums a study identified key equity issues for policy considerations:government-subsidized insurance, such as the u s national flood insurance program, is criticized for providing a perverse incentive to develop properties in hazardous areas, thereby increasing overall risk it is also suggested that insurance can undermine other efforts to increase adaptation, for instance through property level protection and resilience this behavioral effect may be countered with appropriate land-use policies that limit new construction where current or future climate risks are perceived and/or encourage the adoption of resilient building codes to mitigate potential damages policies have been identified as important tools for integrating issues of climate change adaptation at national levels, adaptation strategies may be found in national action plans (naps ) and national adaptation programme of action (napa, in developing countries), and/or in national policies and strategies on climate change these are at different levels of development in different countries cities, states, and provinces often have considerable responsibility in land use planning, public health, and disaster management some have begun to take steps to adapt to threats intensified by climate change, such as flooding, bushfires, heatwaves, and rising sea levels adaptive policy can occur at the global, national, or local scale, with outcomes dependent on the political will in that area scheraga and grambsch identify nine principles to be considered when designing adaptation policy, including the effects of climate change varying by region, demographics, and effectiveness scheraga and grambsch make it clear that climate change policy is impeded by the high level of variance surrounding climate change impacts as well as the diverse nature of the problems they face james titus, project manager for sea level rise at the u s environmental protection agency, identifies the following criteria that policy makers should use in assessing responses to global warming: economic efficiency, flexibility, urgency, low cost, equity, institutional feasibility, unique or critical resources, health and safety, consistency, and private versus public sector adaptation can mitigate the adverse impacts of climate change, but it will incur costs and will not prevent all damage the ipcc points out that many adverse effects of climate change are not changes in the average conditions, but changes in the variation or the extremes of conditions for example, the average sea level in a port might not be as important as the height of water during a storm surge (which causes flooding); the average rainfall in an area might not be as important as how frequent and severe droughts and extreme precipitation events become additionally, effective adaptive policy can be difficult to implement because policymakers are rewarded more for enacting short-term change, rather than long-term planning since the impacts of climate change are generally not seen in the short term, policymakers have less incentive to act furthermore, climate change is occurring on a global scale, leading to global policy and research efforts such as the paris agreement and research through the ipcc, creating a global framework for adapting to and combating climate change the vast majority of climate change adaptation and mitigation policies are being implemented on a more local scale because different regions must adapt differently and because national and global policies are often more challenging to enact the economic costs of adaptation to climate change are likely to cost billions of dollars annually for the next several decades, though the exact amount of money needed is unknown in addition to the direct costs associated with adaptation, there is also an indirect cost arising from a diversion of resources from productive towards adaptive capital (known as the adaptive investment effect) the adaptation challenge grows with the magnitude and the rate of climate change even the most effective climate change mitigation through reduction of greenhouse gas (ghg) emissions or enhanced removal of these gases from the atmosphere (through carbon sinks) would not prevent further climate change impacts, making the need for adaptation unavoidable and the adaptation gap is growing an extensive research literature assesses options for responses to global warming much of this literature addresses the potential economic costs associated with different strategies the asian development bank has a series of studies on the economics of climate change in the asia-pacific region these studies provide cost analysis of both adaptation and mitigation measures the weap (water evaluation and planning system) assists water resources researchers and planners in assessing impacts of and adaptations to climate change the united nations development programme\\'s climate change adaptation portal includes studies on climate change adaptation in africa, europe and central asia, and asia and the pacific in addition to the direct costs associated with spending on adaptation and mitigation there is also research indicating the cost associated with diverting resources away from productive sources towards these adaptation purposes such a diversion is termed the adaptive investment effect (aie) and evidence suggests that the impact of investment on economic growth is reduced by around 30% in areas which invest heavily in adaptive technologies the united nations framework convention on climate change, under article 11, incorporates a financial mechanism to developing country parties to support them with adaptation until 2009, three funds existed under the unfccc financial mechanism the special climate change fund (sccf) and the least developed countries fund (ldcf) are administered by the global environmental facility the adaptation fund was established a result of negotiations during cop15 and cop16 and is administered by its own secretariat initially, when the kyoto protocol was in operation, the adaptation fund was financed by a 2% levy on the clean development mechanism (cdm) at the 2009 copenhagen summit, nations committed to the goal of sending $100 billion per year to developing countries for climate change mitigation and adaptation by 2020 the green climate fund was created in 2010 as one of the channels for mobilizing this climate finance at the 2015 paris conference, it was clarified that the $100 billion per year should involve a balanced split between mitigation and adaptation as of december\\xa02020[update], the promised $100 billion per year had not been fully delivered, and most developing country finance was still targeted towards mitigation, with adaptation only receiving a 21% share of the public finance provided in 2020 a key and defining feature of international adaptation finance is its premise on the concept of additionality this reflects the linkages between adaptation finance and other levels of development aid many developed countries already provide international aid assistance to developing countries to address challenges such as  poverty, malnutrition, food insecurity, availability of drinking water, indebtedness, illiteracy, unemployment, local resource conflicts, and lower technological development climate change threatens to exacerbate or stall progress on fixing some of these pre-existing problems, and creates new problems to avoid existing aid being redirected, additionality refers to the extra costs of adaptation the four main definitions of additionality are:a criticism of additionality is that it encourages business as usual that does not account for the future risks of climate change some advocates have thus proposed integrating climate change adaptation into poverty reduction programs from 2010 to 2020, denmark increased its global warming adaptation aid 33%, from 0 09% of gdp to 0 12% of gdp, but not by additionality instead, the aid was subtracted from other foreign assistance funds politiken wrote: \"climate assistance is taken from the poorest \"adaptation can occur in anticipation of change (anticipatory adaptation), or be a response to those changes (reactive adaptation) for example, artificial snow-making in the european alps responds to current climate trends, whereas construction of the confederation bridge in canada at a higher elevation takes into account the effect of future sea-level rise on ship clearance under the bridge much adaptation takes place in relation to short-term climate variability, however this may cause maladaptation to longer-term climatic trends for example, the expansion of irrigation in egypt into the western sinai desert after a period of higher river flows is a maladaptation when viewed in relation to the longer term projections of drying in the region adaptations at one scale can also create externalities at another by reducing the adaptive capacity of other actors this is often the case when broad assessments of the costs and benefits of adaptation are examined at smaller scales and it is possible to see that whilst the adaptation may benefit some actors, it has a negative effect on others people have always adapted to climatic changes and some community coping strategies already exist, for example changing sowing times or adopting new water-saving techniques traditional knowledge and coping strategies must be maintained and strengthened, otherwise adaptive capacity may be weakened as local knowledge of the environment is lost strengthening these local techniques and building upon them also makes it more likely that adaptation strategies will be adopted, as it creates more community ownership and involvement in the process in many cases this will not be enough to adapt to new conditions which are outside the range of those previously experienced, and new techniques will be needed the incremental adaptations which have been implemented become insufficient as the vulnerabilities and risks of climate change increase, this causes a need for transformational adaptations which are much larger and costlier current development efforts are increasingly focusing on community-based climate change adaptation, seeking to enhance local knowledge, participation and ownership of adaptation strategies ipcc working group ii, the united states national academy of sciences, the united nations disaster risk reduction office,and other science policy experts agree that while mitigating the emission of greenhouse gases is important, adaptation to the effects of global warming will still be necessary there are some synergies and trade-offs between adaptation and mitigation adaptation measures often offer short-term benefits, whereas mitigation has longer-term benefits sometimes climate-relevant actions may point in different directions for instance, compact urban development may lead to reduced transport and building greenhouse gas emissions simultaneously, it may increase the urban heat island effect, leading to higher temperatures and increasing exposure, making adaptation more challenging synergies include the benefits of public transport for both mitigation and adaptation public transport has lower greenhouse gas emissions per kilometer travelled than cars a good public transport network also increases resilience in case of disasters: evacuation and emergency access becomes easier reduced air pollution from public transport improves health, which in turn may lead to improved economic resilience, as healthy workers perform better sustainable development goal 13, which was set in 2015, aims to strengthen countries\\' resilience and adaptive capacities to climate-related issues this adjustment includes many areas such as infrastructure, agriculture and education the paris agreement includes several provisions for adaptation it seeks to promote the idea of global responsibility, improve communication via the adaptation component of the nationally determined contributions, and includes an agreement that developed countries should provide some financial support and technology transfer to promote adaptation in more vulnerable countries a 2020 united nations report found that while 72% of countries had a high level adaptation instrument – such as a plan, policy or strategy – relatively few had progressed to the tangible implementation of projects at least not to the point where the climate risk their populations are exposed to had been significantly reduced a may 2021 report based on a survey of 812 global cities found that while 93% reported they are at risk from climate change, 43% did not have an adaptation plan, and 41% of cities had not carried out a climate risk and vulnerability assessment
